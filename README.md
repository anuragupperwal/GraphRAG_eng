GraphRAG_eng is a project that explores the integration of Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) techniques with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance information retrieval and generation processes. ￼

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to construct and utilize knowledge graphs derived from unstructured text data to improve the performance of LLMs in tasks such as question answering and information summarization. ￼

## Features
	•	Knowledge Graph Construction: Transforms unstructured text into structured knowledge graphs, capturing entities and their relationships.
	•	Enhanced Retrieval: Utilizes graph structures to retrieve contextually relevant information, improving the grounding of LLM responses.
	•	Improved Generation: Augments LLM prompts with structured data from knowledge graphs, leading to more accurate and context-aware outputs. ￼ ￼

## Technologies Used
	•	Python: Primary programming language for implementing the project.
	•	Large Language Models (LLMs): Employed for processing and generating human-like text based on the knowledge graphs.
	•	Graph Databases: Used to store and manage the constructed knowledge graphs.
	•	Graph Algorithms: Applied for analyzing and traversing the knowledge graphs to retrieve relevant information.

## Installation
	1.	Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/anuragupperwal/GraphRAG_eng.git
cd GraphRAG_eng


	2.	Set Up a Virtual Environment:

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate



## Usage
	1.	Prepare Your Data: Place your unstructured text data in the data/ directory. ￼
	2.	Run the Main Script:

python main.py

This will process the data, construct the knowledge graph, and demonstrate retrieval and generation functionalities.

## Project Structure
	•	main.py: Main script that orchestrates the data processing, graph construction, and interaction with the LLM.
	•	data/: Directory containing the unstructured text data to be processed.
	•	README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project. ￼

## Future Work
	•	Integration with Advanced Graph Databases: Enhancing scalability and performance.
	•	User Interface Development: Creating a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.
	•	Evaluation Metrics: Implementing metrics to assess the quality and relevance of the generated outputs. ￼ ￼ ￼
