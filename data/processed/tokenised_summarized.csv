"Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe gains access to a reported 20 million 41.1 million fortune as he turns 18 on Monday. The young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. I dont plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar."
"At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film Hostel Part II. Details of how hell mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans."
Radcliffes earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. His latest outing as the boy wizard in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic. He will reprise the role in the last two films.
"The Londoner has filmed a TV movie called My Boy Jack, about author Rudyard Kipling and his son. He will also appear in December Boys, an Australian film about four boys who escape an orphanage."
"The ninth floor of the MiamiDade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the forgotten floor. Soledad OBrien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill. ""I just think Im going to be more sort of fair game,"" one inmate says of now that he's legally an adult. ""It's going to get worse and worse,"" another inmate says."
"Judge Steven Leifman says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often wont do what theyre told when police arrive on the scene. confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because theyre in jail."
"We toured the jail with Leifman. He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Go inside theforgotten floor . At first, its hard to determine where the people are."
The prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes. Theyre designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. Leifman says about onethird of all people in MiamiDade county jails are mentally ill.
"So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor. We see two, sometimes three men  sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells. I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!"
"one man shouts at me. Leifman tells me that these prisonerpatients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. Its brutally unjust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami."
"Leifman says 200 years ago people were considered lunatics and they were locked up in jails. Over the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals. But many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down."
"In 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals. Today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals, judge says. Starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the forgotten floor will instead be sent to a new mental health facility."
"Leifman says the best part is that its a winwin solution. The patients win, the families are relieved, and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again. And, for Leifman, justice is served."
"I probably had a 30, 35foot free fall. The whole bridge is down. I realized there was a school bus right next to me. Me and a couple of other guys went over and started lifting the kids off the bridge."
"Dr. John Hink, an emergency room physician, rushed to the scene in 15 minutes. He arrived at the south side of the bridge, stood on the riverbank and saw dozens of people lying dazed."
"They were in the middle of the Mississippi River, which was churning fast. Ambulances were also having a hard time driving down to the river to get closer to the scene. Volunteers, EMTs and other officials managed to get 55 people into ambulances in less than two hours."
"The rescue effort was controlled and organized, he said the opposite of the lightningquick collapse. Babineau said the rear of his pickup truck was dangling over the edge of a brokenoff section of the bridge. ""It just gave a rumble real quick, and it all just gave way,"" he said."
"He said several vehicles slid past him into the water. ""I stayed in my car for one or two seconds. I saw a couple cars fall,"" he said. ""Then I got out real quick, ran in front of my truck and I helped a woman off of the bridge with me"""
I started grabbing kids and handing them down. It was just complete chaos. He said most of the children were crying or screaming. He and other rescuers set them on the ground and told them to run.
"Babineau said he had no rescue training. Melissa Hughes, 32, of Minneapolis, said she was driving home when the western edge of the bridge collapsed under her."
"A pickup landed on top of her car, but she was not hurt. ""I literally thought I was dead. My truck was completely face down, pointed toward the ground,"" she said."
"It was folded in half, and I cant believe Im alive. Bernie Toivonen told CNNs American Morning that his vehicle was on a part of the bridge that ended up tilted at a 45degree angle. I just put in park, turned the key off and said,Oh, Im alive,  he said."
"Doctors remove five small polyps from President Bush's colon. None appeared worrisome, White House spokesman says. All were small, less than a centimeter half an inch in diameter. Bush is in good humor, and will resume his activities at Camp David."
"Bush reclaimed presidential power at 921 a.m. after about two hours. Doctors used monitored anesthesia care, so the president was asleep, but not as deeply unconscious as with a true general anesthetic. He spoke to first lady Laura Bush  who is in Midland, Texas, celebrating her mothers birthday."
"Cheney spent the morning at his home on Marylands eastern shore, reading and playing with his dogs. He planned to have lunch at Camp David and have briefings with National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley and White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten. The procedure was supervised by Dr. Richard Tubb, Bushs physician, and conducted by a multidisciplinary team."
"The presidents doctor had recommended a repeat procedure in about five years. A colonoscopy is the most sensitive test for colon cancer, rectal cancer and polyps, small clumps of cells that can become cancerous. Small polyps may be removed during the procedure."
The American Cancer Society recommends that people without high risk factors or symptoms begin getting screened for signs of colorectal cancer at age 50. The National Football League has indefinitely suspended Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick without pay.
A judge will have the final say on a plea deal. Vick admitted to participating in a dogfighting ring as part of a plea agreement. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said he would review the status of the suspension after the legal proceedings are over.
Vick also admitted that he and two coconspirators killed dogs that did not fight well. Falcons owner Arthur Blank said Vicks admissions describe actions that are incomprehensible and unacceptable. Goodell said the Falcons could assert any claims or remedies to recover 22 million of Vicks signing bonus.
"Vick said he would plead guilty to one count of Conspiracy to Travel in Interstate Commerce in Aid of Unlawful Activities. The charge is punishable by up to five years in prison, a 250,000 fine, full restitution, a special assessment and 3 years of supervised release. Federal prosecutors agreed to ask for the low end of the sentencing guidelines. The defendant will plead guilty because the defendant is in fact guilty of the charged offense."
"Most of theBad Newz Kennels operations and gambling monies were provided by Vick. Gambling wins were generally split among coconspirators Tony Taylor, Quanis Phillips and sometimes Purnell Peace. Vick did not gamble by placing side bets on any of the fights."
"Vick is scheduled to appear in court Monday. Peace, Phillips and Vick agreed to the killing of 68 dogs that did not perform well intesting sessions at 1915 Moonlight Road. Vick agrees and stipulates that these dogs all died as a result of the collective efforts of the three, according to a statement from Vicks. The three others already have accepted agreements to plead guilty in exchange for reduced sentences."
"The judge in the case will have the final say over the plea agreement. The risk for Vick is, if he makes admissions in his federal guilty plea, the state of Virginia could say,Hey, look, you admitted violating Virginia state law as well. It sometimes happens  not often  that the state will follow a federal prosecution by charging its own crimes."
Vick agreed to make restitution for the full amount of the costs associated with the dogs that are being held by the government. Vick also agreed to turn over any documents he has and to submit to polygraph tests. Vick agreed to cooperate with investigators and provide all information he may have on any criminal activity and to testify if necessary.
"Prosecutors, with the support of animal rights activists, have asked for permission to euthanize the dogs. The dogs could serve as important evidence in the cases against Vick and his admitted coconspirators. Judge Henry E. Hudson issued an order telling the U.S. Marshals Service to arrest and seize the defendant property."
"After Vicks indictment last month, Goodell ordered the quarterback not to report to the Falcons training camp. Blank told the NFL Network on Monday he could not speculate on Vicks future as a Falcon, at least not until he had seen a statement of facts in the case. Youssif held his sisters hand Friday, seemingly unaware that millions of people across the world have been touched by his story."
"Youssif turns 6 next Friday. He is wearing a facial mask often used to help burn victims. I was so happy I didnt know what to do with myself, his mother, Zainab, told CNN."
"His father said he was on the roof of his house when CNN called him with the news. Like his wife, he couldnt stop smiling. He talked about how he tried in vain to get help for his son in Baghdad."
There were many trips to the Ministry of Health. He says he even put in a request to Iraqs parliament for help. No one has been arrested or held accountable in Youssifs case.
The Childrens Burn Foundation has agreed to pay for the transportation for Youssif and his family to come to the United States. The foundation says it will cover all medical costs from surgeries to housing costs to any social rehabilitation that might be needed for him. You can make a donation at the foundations site by clicking here. Theres a dropdown menu under the general donation area that is marked Y Moussifs fund.
"Surgeries will be performed by Dr. Peter Grossman, a plastic surgeon with the affiliated Grossman Burn Center. Officials are still trying to get the appropriate visas for the familys travels. We expect that the treatment will be from between six months to a year with many surgeries."
Youssifs parents said they know its going to be a lengthy and difficult process and that adjusting to their stay in America may not be easy. But none of that matters  getting help for their boy is first and foremost.
"The biggest obstacle now is getting the visas to leave, and the serious security risks they face. That is partly due to the tens of thousands of CNN.com users who were so moved by the story and wanted to act. CNN Iraqi staff central to bringing this story together were also overwhelmed with the generosity coming from people outside of their border."
"The women are too afraid and ashamed to show their faces or have their real names used. Suha, 37, is a mother of three. She says her husband thinks she is cleaning houses when she leaves home."
"People shouldnt criticize women, or talk badly about them, says 37-year-old Suha. A mother of three, she wears light makeup, a gold pendant of Iraq around her neck. I have to do anything that I can to preserve my child, because I am a mother, she says."
"Anger and frustration rise in her voice as she speaks. Her clasped hands clench and unclench nervously. No matter what else I may be, no matter how off the path I might be, I am a mother."
"At the start I was cleaning homes, but I wasnt making much. No matter how hard I worked it just wasnt enough. My husband died of lung cancer nine months ago and left me with nothing. She has five children, ages 8 to 17."
"She was solicited the first time when she was cleaning an office. They took advantage of me, she says softly. At first I rejected it, but then I realized I have to do it."
"Or they flag down vehicles. Prostitution is a choice more and more Iraqi women are making just to survive. Violence, increased cost of living, and lack of any sort of government aid leave women like these with few other options."
"There is a population of women who have to sell their bodies in order to keep their children alive, says Yanar Mohammed, head and founder of the Organization for Womens Freedom in Iraq. Her team pounds the streets of Baghdad looking for these victims often too humiliated to come forward. ""It crushes us to see them, but we have to work on it,"" she says."
"Most of the women that we find at hospitals who have tried to commit suicide have been involved in prostitution, says Basma Rahim. Rahim tells the heartbreaking story of one woman who lives in a room with three of her children. She has sex while her three children are in the room, but she makes them stand in separate corners, she says. The teams aim is to compile information on specific cases and present it to Iraqs political parties."
"Karima says when she sees her children with food on the table, she is able to convince herself that its worth it. But she says, I would never allow my daughter to do this. I would rather marry her off at 13 than have her go through this."
"Karimas last happy memory is of her late husband, when they were a family and able to shoulder the hardships of life in todays Iraq together. Suha says as a young girl she dreamed of being a doctor, with her mom boasting about her potential in that career."
"Tomas Medina Caracas was a member of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia. He had been in the crosshairs of the U.S. Justice Department since 2002. He was killed in an air attack on a guerrilla encampment, the Colombian military said. He is known popularly as El Negro Acacio, according to Interpol."
"U.S. officials alleged Medina Caracas managed the rebel groups sales of cocaine to international drug traffickers. He was also indicted in the United States along with two other FARC commanders in November 2002. Officials said the armys Rapid Response Force, backed by elements of the Colombian Air Force, tracked Medina Car Venezuel down at a FARC camp in the jungle in the south of the country. After a bombardment, the troops occupied the camp, and theyve found 14 dead rebels so far."
"The death ofEl Negro Acacio was confirmed by various sources, including members of FARC itself. Medina Caracas commanded FARCs 16th Front in the southern departments of Vichada and Guainia. Established in 1964 as the military wing of the Colombian Communist Party, FARC is Colombias oldest, largest, most capable and bestequipped Marxist rebel group."
"White House press secretary Tony Snow will step down from his post on September 14. President Bush told reporters Friday that he will sadly accept Snows resignation. Its been a joy to watch him spar with you, Bush said."
"Snow said he was leaving to earn more money. He took a big pay cut, he said, when he left his previous jobs as anchor and political analyst for Fox News. Bush: Hell battle cancer and win, and hell be a solid contributor to society."
"According to The Washington Post, Snow makes 168,000 as the White House spokesman. His family took out a loan when he started the job, and that loan is now gone. He said he would continue to speak out on issues, and would do some radio, some TV."
"Snows cancer was diagnosed for the first time in February 2005. His colon was removed, and after six months of treatment, doctors said the cancer was in remission. Sources told CNN two weeks ago that Snow was planning to leave his job, possibly as early as September."
"Bush tapped Snow to replace Scott McClellan in April 2006. Snow had been an anchor for Fox News Sunday and a political analyst for the Fox News Channel. On Thursday, Snow told CNN his health is improving, citing two medical tests this month."
"Snow's black hair is expected to grow back in about a month. Snow said on Friday he was to see his oncologist, and they will decide on some minor forms of chemotherapy to start as maintenance treatment."
"Niranjan Desai discovered the 20-year-old AT4 antitank rocket launcher tube. The launcher has been turned over to U.S. Army officials at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. Police say the launcher is no longer operable and not considered a hazard to public safety. There was no indication the launcher had been fired recently, police said, adding there is no indication it was fired recently."
"The nearest military base, Fort Dix, is more than 70 miles from Jersey City. The Joint Terrorism Task Force division of the FBI and Jersey City police are investigating the origin of the rocket launcher. A neighbor, Joe Quinn, said the object lying on Desais lawn looked military, was brown, had a handle and strap, and both ends were open, like you could shoot something with it."
"An Army official said the device is basically a shoulderfired, directfire weapon. A loaded M136 AT4 antitank weapon has a 40inchlong fiberglasswrapped tube. Its 84 millimeter shapedcharge missile can penetrate 14 inches of armor from a maximum of 985 feet."
"President Bush to tell Veterans of Foreign Wars that real problem was U.S. presence. Three decades later, there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the Vietnam War, Bush will say. One unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of Americas withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens, he will say, according to speech excerpts released Tuesday by the White House. ""boat people,reeducation camps andkilling fields"" are among the terms Bush will use."
"The president will also make the argument that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened todays terrorists by compromising U.S. credibility. The president will cite a quote from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden that the American people would rise against the Iraq war the same way they rose against the war in Vietnam, according to the excerpts. Here at home, some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility, but the terrorists see things differently, Bush will say. The President continues to staythecourse with his failed strategy in Iraq, paid for by the taxpayers, said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid."
"The White House is billing the speech, along with another address next week to the American Legion, as an effort to provide broader context for the debate. It is being closely watched on Capitol Hill, particularly by Republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war. President Bush has frequently asked lawmakers  and the American people to withhold judgment on his troop surge in Iraq until the report comes out in September."
"Bush will invoke other historical comparisons from Asia, including the U.S. defeat and occupation of Japan after World War II and the Korean War in the 1950s. A recent CNNOpinion Research Corporation poll found that almost twothirds of Americans now oppose the Iraq war, and 72 percent say that even if Petraeus reports progress, it wont change their opinion. 53 percent said they do not trust Petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in Iraq. Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 troops in Iraq might begin."
"Many thought it naive to help the Japanese transform themselves into a democracy, Bush will say. Today, in defiance of the critics, Japan... stands as one of the worlds great free societies, he says. Bush will also talk about the Korean War, saying that at the time critics argued that the war was futile, that we never should have sent our troops in."
"A second car packed with gas and nails was later found to have been parked just a few hundred yards from the first. The second car was towed away by traffic wardens in the early hours of Friday for violating parking restrictions. Without Americas intervention during the war, millions of South Koreans would now be living under a brutal and repressive regime. A chronology of bombings and attempted bomb attacks in the mainland UK since the 1970s."
"Police say two vehicles clearly linked. Four suicide bombers detonate themselves aboard three underground trains and a bus in a morning rush hour attack on July 7, 2005. Al Qaeda claims responsibility in a video statement. Two weeks after the deadly 77 bombings, four men are alleged to have attempted to carry out a second wave of attacks against Londons transport network."
"A car bomb explodes outside the BBCs London headquarters, wounding one man. Police blame the Real IRA, a republican splinter group opposed to the IRAs cease fire. April 1999 Three people die when a nail bomb explodes in the Admiral Duncan pub in Londons gay district. Seven men are convicted in May 2007 and sentenced to up to 26 years in prison."
"A 23yearold selfdeclared Nazi, David Copeland, is sentenced to six life terms. A massive IRA bomb explodes in a shopping center in central Manchester, injuring more than 200 people. Two boys aged three and 12 are killed and dozens are injured by two bombs left in litter bins in Warrington, northern England."
"The IRA admits planting the bombs. April 1992 A huge IRA car bomb in Londons financial district kills three people and wounds 91. February 1991 IRA terrorists launch a mortar attack at Prime Minister John Majors Downing Street offices. September 1989 Eleven people die and 22 are wounded when an IRA bomb explodes at a Royal Marine music school in Deal, southern England."
"Libyan agent Abdel Basset alMegrahi, convicted of the attack in 2001, was this week granted the right to mount a fresh appeal. October 1984 Five people die in an IRA bomb attack on a hotel in Brighton, southern England, where Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her cabinet are staying. December 1983 An IRA bomb at Londons Harrods department store kills six people."
Carlos Alberto has joined Bundesliga club Werder Bremen for a club record fee of 7.8 million euros 10.7 million. The 22-year-old enjoyed success at FC Porto under Jose Mourinho. Alberto scored in FC Portos Champions League final victory against Monaco in 2004.
"Carlos Alberto started his career with Fluminense, and helped them to lift the Campeonato Carioca in 2002. In January 2004 he moved on to FC Porto, who were coached by José Mourinho, and won the Portuguese title as well as the Champions League. Early in 2005, he moved to Corinthians, where he impressed as they won the Brasileirão. In 2006 Corinthians had a poor season and Carlos Alberto found himself at odds with manager, Emerson Leão. He declared that he would not play for Corinthians again while Leão remained as manager. Since January this year he has been on loan with his first"
"Bundesliga champions VfB Stuttgart said on Sunday that they would sign a loan agreement with Real Zaragoza on Monday for Ewerthon. On Friday, Ailton returned to Germany where he was the leagues top scorer in 2004, signing a oneyear deal with Duisburg on a transfer from Red Star Belgrade. Vice President Dick Cheney will serve as acting president briefly Saturday while President Bush is anesthetized for a routine colonoscopy."
"A colonoscopy is the most sensitive test for colon cancer, rectal cancer and polyps. The procedure will be supervised by Dr. Richard Tubb and conducted by a multidisciplinary team from the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. Small polyps may be removed during the procedure."
Snow said that was the case when Bush had colonoscopies before becoming president. Snow himself is undergoing chemotherapy for cancer that began in his colon and spread to his liver.
"Magnitude 4.2 earthquake shakes San Francisco area Friday at 442 a.m. PT. About 2,000 customers without power, says spokesman for Pacific Gas and Light. Under USGS classification, a magnitude 4. 2 earthquake is considered light. American Cancer Society recommends screening for colorectal cancer at age 50."
"The quake was centered about two miles eastnortheast of Oakland, at a depth of 3.6 miles. Oakland is just east of San Francisco, across San Francisco Bay. No injuries or damage has been reported."
"An Oakland police dispatcher told CNN the quake set off alarms at peoples homes. The shaking lasted about 50 seconds, said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. According to the USGS, magnitude 4.2 quakes are felt indoors and may break dishes and windows."
"Over the past 25 days, the Mine Safety and Health Administration has exhausted all known options in our attempt to reach the six miners. The thoughts and prayers of the dedicated professionals at MSHA are with the families. President Bush: Last night, a difficult decision was made to end the search."
"Labor Secretary Elaine Chao called the ordeal heartbreaking. The grueling aroundtheclock rescue operation has taken a tremendous toll on the many brave rescuers and the local community, Chao said. After drilling seven holes into mine tunnels from the mountaintop above, there has been no sign of the miners."
"We basically told the families that at this point in time weve run out of options, Stickler says. There were no public statements Saturday from Bob Murray, president and CEO of Murray Mining. Murray was the outspoken face of the rescue operation for the first three weeks, then largely disappeared from public view. The rescue operation has now lasted nearly four weeks, the rescue team says. The search for the missing is expected to continue into next week."
"Federal officials became the spokesmen. No one from Murray Mining was present at Fridays news conference. The men were trapped during a collapse on August 6, and it is not known whether they survived the cavein."
"Efforts to reach them were suspended 10 days later when two rescuers and a federal mining official were killed. Murray said last week that the search effort would stop if no signs of life were found at the sixth hole. Under pressure from the families, however, he agreed to try one more time."
"Work resumed Friday, this time at the fourth hole. The camera could only descend about 7 feet, he said. ""There was quite a bit of mud in there, water coming down the hole,"" Stickler said of the latest try. ""It really couldnt go any farther than seven feet"""
"Murray said he has already filed paperwork with federal regulators to permanently close and seal the Crandall Canyon mine. Friends and family have identified the six missing miners as Luis Hernandez, Manuel Sanchez, Kerry Allred, Carlos Payan, Brandon Phillips and Don Erickson."
"The explosion occurred at 5 p.m. about 20 meters 65 feet from a mosque in Batna, a town about 450 kilometers 280 miles east of Algiers. The bomb went off 15 minutes before the expected arrival of President AbdelAziz Bouteflika. It wasnt clear if the bomb was caused by a suicide bomber or if it was planted."
"Algeria faces a continuing Islamic insurgency, according to the CIA. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing. In July, 33 people were killed in apparent suicide bombings in Algiers that were claimed by an al Qaedaaffiliated group. The attack took place in the city of Batna."
Bouteflika said terrorist acts have nothing in common with the noble values of Islam. David Beckham is headed for the Hollywood Hills as he takes his game to U.S. Major League Soccer. CNN looks at how Bekham fulfilled his dream of playing for Manchester United.
"Beckham has begun a fiveyear contract with the Los Angeles Galaxy team. On Friday Beckham will meet the press and reveal his new shirt number. CNN will look back at the life of Beckham, the wonderfully talented youngster who fulfilled his dream of playing for Manchester United, his marriage to pop star Victoria, and the trials and tribulations ofPlaying for England.

"Virus found in healthy Australian honey bees may be playing a role in the collapse of honey bee colonies across the United States. Colony collapse disorder has killed millions of bees. Up to 90 percent of colonies in some U.S. beekeeping operations have been destroyed. The crops largely dependent upon bees for pollination include oranges, blueberries, apples and almonds."
" colony collapse disorder was first reported in the U.S. in 2004. The disorder is marked by hives left with a queen, a few newly hatched adults and plenty of food. The virus identified in the healthy Australian bees is Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus IAPV. For some reason, the Australian bees seem to be resistant to the virus and do not come down with symptoms."
"Scientists used genetic analyses of bees collected over the past three years. They found that IAPV was present in bees that had come from colony collapse disorder hives 96 percent of the time. But the study cautioned that collapse disorder is likely caused by several factors. This could explain why bees in Australia may be resistant to colony collapse, the study says."
"There are no cases... in Australia at all, entomologist Dave Britton of the Australian Museum said last month. It is a Northern Hemisphere phenomenon. Researchers also say varroa mites affect all hives on the U.S. mainland but are not found in Australia."
"One nagging problem has been a general inability to treat or vaccinate bees against viruses of any kind. But in the case of IAPV, there is evidence that some bees carry genetic resistance to the disorder. This is yet one more argument for beekeepers to use honey bee stocks that are genetically disease and pestresistant. Bee researchers will now look for stresses that may combine to kill bees."
"Long lines formed before counters opened at the Northern Rock building society. Customers are believed to have already withdrawn about 1 billion 2 billion since the banks woes were revealed. Speculation that the global credit crunch made raising funds through commercial borrowing difficult. Other researchers involved in the study include researchers from Pennsylvania State University, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, the University of Arizona and 454 Life Sciences. and Columbia University."
Shares in Northern Rock dropped up to 30 percent in Friday trading. British Bankers Association has urged customers to calm down. Finance minister Alistair Darling said the Bank of England had stepped in to create a stable banking system. He said people can use their accounts in the usual way.
Northern Rock will be able to carry on its business. Chief executive Adam Applegarth said the bank had yet to draw on the emergency cash. Former football star O.J. Simpson will be held without bail after his arrest on robbery and assault charges.
"Simpson is accused of having directed several other men in an alleged armed robbery of sports memorabilia. Las Vegas authorities said they have no information leading them to believe Simpson was carrying a firearm during the alleged incident. Police said Simpson and other men burst into the room and walked out with the memorabilia, including some that was unrelated to Simpson."
"A reporter asked Nichols Was O.J. was the boss in that room? Nichols responded, That is what we believe, yes. The alleged victims were identified as Bruce Fromong, a sports memorabilia collector."
"Acting on a tip, police met over the weekend at McCarran International Airport with 46-year-old Walter Alexander, of Mesa, Arizona. Alexander was arrested Saturday night on two counts of robbery with a deadly weapon. He was released on his own recognizance and returned to Mesa either Saturday night or early Sunday morning."
"Two firearms that police said were used were recovered early Sunday in one of three searches. Investigators would would not divulge where the weapons were found. Nichols dismissed an initial report that the men may have been offduty police. There is no truth to that whatsoever, he said."
"Simpson, 60, has acknowledged taking some items that belonged to him, but he has denied that any weapons were involved. Nichols also said that some of the property taken had Simpsons signature."
"I believe there were some Joe Montana cleats and some signed baseballs and other stuff. Simpson was acquitted of murder the following year. In 1997, a jury found him liable for the deaths in a civil case brought by the Goldman family."
"Simpson was ordered to pay the families a total of 33.5 million for the deaths. Goldman had gone to Nicole Simpsons Los Angeles home to return a pair of glasses the day of the slayings. Goldmans sister, Kim Goldman, said she wasnt surprised by the robbery allegations, since Simpson thinks he can do no wrong."
"Simpson recently wrote a book originally titled If I Did It and had planned to publish it himself, but a public outcry led to the cancellation of his book deal. A bankruptcy judge subsequently awarded the Goldmans the rights to the book in light of their inability to collect the wrongful death award."
"Anthony Ogadje, 25, and nine other contestants had gone to Shere Hills Lake in Nigerias hilly Plateau State to prepare for the Gulder Ultimate Search. The show sets a variety of physical challenges for participants. Heinekens local unit which is sponsoring the show has suspended the show."
"All attempts to revive him by the attendant medical team and the lifeguards, including his fellow contestants, failed. Broadcasting had been due to start on Thursday. In the show, the weakest contestants are evicted one by one until a winner emerges. The prize money is a big attraction in a country where most people live in extreme poverty and benefit little from Nigerias oil wealth."
"A former government contract employee was indicted on charges of stealing restricted nuclear energyrelated materials. Sources say the classified materials were taken from the East Tennessee Technology Park. The Ultimate Search, which started in 2004, gets high ratings."
"Roy Lynn Oakley, 67, of Roane County, Tennessee, appeared in federal court in Knoxville on Thursday. Oakley was briefly detained for questioning in the case in January, when authorities first learned of the alleged plot to divulge the materials. He voluntarily surrendered Thursday at an FBI field office inKnoxville, sources say. Oakly is a former employee of Bechtel Jacobs, the Department of Energys prime environmental management contractor."
"The transfer took place January 26, the indictment alleges. Oakley is also charged with converting the material and restricted data to his own use. Prosecutors said the materials involved have been examined by scientists and posed no threat to people who may have come into contact with them."
"Moncier said Oakley had a security clearance, but Moncier did not believe it was a highlevel clearance. The government alleges that in January, Oakley attempted to sell the pieces of scrap to someone he thought was a French agent. He said he questions whether those broken pieces would be considered an appliance under the law."
"The equipment was never transmitted to a foreign government or terrorist organization. The materials involved are not the crown jewels, but they should not have been taken from the facility, a source says. A barrier is used to filter uranium during the enrichment process, but a significant number of barriers are needed to do that job, officials say. The suspect apparently did not make contact with any foreign government and is not a foreign agent of any kind, an official familiar with the case says."
"A government official with with knowledge of the case said that when authorities learned of Oakleys alleged intentions six months ago, the FBI and Department of Energy launched a joint investigation. East Tennessee Technology Park is an area of the DOEs Oak Ridge reservation where we are currently decontaminating and decommissioning buildings that were last used in 1985. When they were in use, now over 20 years ago, some of the buildings at ETTP housed facilities used for the enrichment of uranium."
Chelsea are waiting on the fitness of defender John Terry. Terry suffered a broken cheekbone during Saturday's draw with Fulham. Frank Lampard has been ruled out of Wednesday's Champions League match. Click here for more Chelsea news.. Click HERE for more Arsenal news. and more Tottenham Hotspur news.
"Terry trained at Valencias Mestalla stadium with a face mask on after surgery on Sunday. Grant has confirmed that Lampard will definitely sit out though as the midfielder continues to recover from his thigh injury. Midfielder Michael Essien, who scored a lastminute winner for Chelsea to knock Valencia out of last seasons Champions League, has also been battling a leg injury."
"A dire shortage of donated organs in rich countries is sending foreigners to poorer places like China, Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, Colombia and the Philippines. Paul Lee got his liver from an executed Chinese prisoner Karam in Egypt bought a kidney for his sister for 5,300 in Istanbul Hakan is holding out for 30,700 for one of his kidneys. Doctors in Pakistan have been arrested for abducting people, drugging them and stealing their kidneys."
"That April, he paid 260,000 yuan 34,380 for a transplant  surgery that saved his life. The hospital has connections with a lot of prisons, Lee told Reuters. The World Health Organization estimates that 21,000 liver transplants are carried out annually."
"Demand for kidneys also exceeds supply, and that has given rise to organ trafficking. A donor in South Africa receives 700 for a kidney compared with 30,000 in the United States. A lack of transparency and little protection for donors has spurred calls by international bodies to crack down on, or at least regulate, the trade."
"Any transplant procedure involving a living donor carries risks for the donor. complications can include bleeding, infection, even death. In the transplant trade, the recipient need not worry about exposing a living relative to that risk. It is cheaper and your next of kin is not taking the risk and you dont have to care for someone you dont know."
"Only 20,000 transplants are carried out in China each year. Of these, 3,000 are liver transplants and 95 percent use livers from dead donors. A transplant operation using the liver of a dead donor costs around 33,000 in China."
"In Asia, a cultural obsession with keeping the body of the deceased intact has stymied public organ donation programs. Excluding China, Asia has fewer than 200 livers donated by people ahead of their death each year. Pakistan, where trade in human organs is not illegal, is turning into a kidney bazaar, said the chief executive of Pakistans Kidney Foundation, Jaffar Naqvi. There are no confirmed figures for the number of foreigners coming to the country for new kidneys."
"Patients, mostly from Europe, Saudi Arabia and India, pay about 500,000 rupees 8,500 for a new kidney. Donors are paid 300 to 1,000 and often get no medical care after the surgery. In May police arrested nine people, four of them doctors, for abducting people."
"Stories of people selling their organs, especially kidneys, are not uncommon in Egypt. More than 30 percent of a population of more than 73 million people live below the poverty line. Such a clause allowing altruistic organ donations will ensure the trade continues with secret payment to donors, Naqvi said. He said a doctor found him a man willing to sell his kidney for 30,000 Egyptian pounds 5,300."
"Both his money and the fees of the hospital were deducted from the money thedonor received, said Karam. Doctors usually help in finding people willing to sell their organs from their patients lists. Egyptian law lacks clear punishment for those involved in illegal transplants, making it easy for doctors to repeat the offence."
The union has been pushing for legislation to regulate organ transplants. The draft bill includes heavy fines and a prison sentence for those involved. But the draft law has been languishing in parliament for several years. This is because of differences between doctors and senior Muslim religious leaders.
"In Turkey, students, unemployed young men and struggling fathers post adverts on the Internet selling their kidneys. These wouldbe donors say they have had enquiries from Germany, Israel and Turkey with asking prices going up to 50,000 lira 38,760. Hakan, a 27yearold security guard in Istanbul with two young children who also requested only his first name be published, said he received five or six offers from Turkey and Germany."
"Hollywood filmmakers are asking about Lindsay Lohan following her legal troubles. Lohan may still get work after her legal problems are settled, but the cost will be high.Ive got two children... theres nothing else I can do for them."
"Lohan fans have little to fear because no actor is uninsurable, say underwriting experts. Lohans arrest this week in Los Angeles on suspicion of drunken driving and cocaine possession has left Hollywood wondering if the actress is too risky to cast in a film. For a price, anything can be done, although an insurance carrier can make things so unpalatable that at times the makers of the film just wont be interested, said Ross Miller, partner with insurance brokerage D.R. Reiff  Associates Inc."
"A statement was expected early next week on whether the movie, already delayed this spring due to an earlier rehab stint by Lohan, will proceed with or without her. Insurance experts say the industry has long dealt with similar situations, although they may seem more frequent with the recent heavy media scrutiny."
"The terms for covering Lohan would likely be serious at this point. Firemans Fund would likely put in higher deductibles, or ask the star to put their salary into escrow to pay for any losses if production was disrupted. Last July, a producer on Lohans last film, Georgia Rule, scolded her publicly for repeatedly showing up late on the set."
"Insurance rates for errant actors can range anywhere from 1 percent to 3 percent of a movies production budget, which can range from 5 million to 100 million. Brian Kingman, a managing director with entertainment insurance broker AonAlbert G. Ruben said covering situations like Lohans required a lot of calculation and risk management."
"In cases of known drug abuse, minders are sometimes required on set to keep an eye on the actor. Kingman said he had even helped craft policies for actors in the event they risked the possibility of incarceration. I have been successful in finding and creating incarceration coverage for certain actors on probation which can be revoked if they break certain rules, he said."
"Roma striker Totti has complained that the Italian players are never listened to. The row began last month, when the Italian Football League voted to start the season on August 26. In doing so, they ignored a request by Italy coach Roberto Donadoni to play the first round of matches midway through the month, to give his players time to gain matchfitness."
" Serie A is one of the last major European leagues to start next season. The opening round of English Premier League matches is scheduled to start on August 11, while the French Ligue 1 will kick off on August 4. The national team wanted to have an extra weeks rest at Christmas and allow the national team to come into the big matches in September better prepared."
"Allegations that Blackwater USA was complicit in unlawful arms activities are baseless. Federal prosecutors are investigating allegations that employees of Blackwater illegally purchased weapons and sold them in Iraq. 20 Iraqi civilians were shot to death last weekend. Blackwater, which is based in Moyock, North Carolina, is a security firm hired by the State Department to guard U.S. staff."
The company has no knowledge of any employee improperly exporting weapons. Blackwater immediately fired them and invited the ATF to conduct a thorough investigation. State Department Inspector General Howard Krongard was accused of blocking fraud investigations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The State Department has been cooperating with the prosecutors in the Blackwater probe.
"Blackwater resumed normal security operations in Iraq on Friday. Iraqi government was outraged by the shootings and disputes the U.S. and Blackwaters claim that the guards were responding to an attack. Blackwater investigating alleged smuggling of weapons into Iraq by a contractor, Krongards statement says. The State Department said Blackwater resumed operations after a brief hiatus following the incident last Sunday."
"Youssif has always been a huge SpiderMan fan. Meeting him was my favorite thing, he said. Spidey then gave the boy from a faraway land a gentle hug, embracing him in his iconic blue and red tights."
"He showed Youssif a few tricks, like how to shoot a web from his wrist. Other superheroes crowded around to get a closer look."
He didnt take a liking to SpiderMans nemesis. Spidey was just too cool. I want to see him again.
"Youssif met SpongeBob, Lassie and a 3year-old orangutan named Archie. The hairy, brownishred primate took to the boy, grabbing his hand and holding it."
The boy giggled inside a play area where spongelike balls shot out of toy guns. He squealed with delight and raced around the room collecting as many balls as he could. He rode a tram through the back stages at Universal Studios.
"Fire and smoke filled the air, debris cascaded down and a big rig skidded toward the vehicle. The boy and his family survived the pretend earthquake unscathed."
"Youssif pushed his 14monthold sister, Ayaa, in a stroller. Just a day earlier, the mother and father talked about their journey out of Iraq and to the United States."
"They also discussed that day nine months ago when masked men grabbed their son outside the family home, doused him in gas and set him on fire. The father sought help for his boy across Baghdad, but no one listened."
He could hear his boys piercing screams from the other side of the hospital. The father knew that speaking to CNN would put his familys lives in jeopardy. The possibility of being killed was better than seeing his son suffer.
"We had to do it. They described a life of utter chaos in Baghdad. Neighbors had recently given birth to a baby girl. Shortly afterward, the father was kidnapped and killed."
"Under Saddam Hussein, there was more security and stability, they said. The couple said they had heard reports that a young girl was kidnapped and beheaded and her killers sewed a dogs head on the corpse and delivered it to her familys doorstep."
"There was running water and electricity most of the time. But still life was tough under the dictator, like the time when Zainabs uncle disappeared and was never heard from again. Iraq finished, he said in what few English words he knows. His homeland wont be enjoying such freedoms anytime soon."
"His two children have only seen war. But this week, the family has seen a much different side of America. An outpouring of generosity and a peaceful nation at home."
"At Universal Studios, he looked out across the valley below. The sun glistened off treetops and buildings. It was a picturesque sight fit for a Hollywood movie."
"Trent D. Thomas was found guilty Wednesday of kidnapping and conspiracy to commit several offenses. Thomas will be demoted to the rank of entrylevel private and will receive a badconduct discharge. The 25-year-old was among seven Marines and a Navy medic who were charged in connection with the death of Hashim Ibrahim Awad, 52. The Marines accused in the case were members of Kilo Company."
"Residents of Hamdaniya, including relatives of the victim, gave a different account. Prosecutors accuse the groups squad leader, Sgt. Lawrence G. Hutchins III, of dragging Awad from his home, shooting him in the street and then making it look like he had planned to ambush American troops."
"He faces a sentence of life in prison if convicted. Thomas changed his plea from guilty to not guilty in February. He told his attorneys that what happened overseas happened as a result of obedience to orders, and he hasnt done anything wrong, defense attorney Victor Kelley said."
"Prince Harry led tributes to Diana, Princess of Wales on the 10th anniversary of her death. He described her as the best mother in the world in a speech at a memorial service. Harry: 'William and I can separate life into two parts'"
"And then there are the 10 years since our mothers death. When she was alive, we completely took for granted her unrivaled love of life, laughter, fun and folly. She was our guardian, friend and protector."
"Behind the media glare, to us, just two loving children, she was quite simply the best mother in the world. She kissed us last thing at night. Her beaming smile greeted us from school."
"She encouraged us when we were nervous or unsure. She like our father was determined to provide us with a stable and secure childhood. To lose a parent so suddenly at such a young age is indescribably shocking and sad. But what is far more important to us now, and into the future, is that we remember our mother as she would have wished to be remembered."
"We both think of her every day. We speak about her and laugh together at all the memories. Put simply, she made us, and so many other people, happy."
"I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name. I pray that you may have the power to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge. Now to Him who by the power at work within us is able to accomplish abundantly far more than all we can ask or imagine, to Him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus."
The scene is an old peoples home. Two residents are playing Beggar My Neighbor. The question from the royal visitor is unexpected. Afterwards they comment on her large eyes and what life she brought into the room.
"Everyone here will have their own memories. I remember meeting Princess Diana for the very first time early in 1981 to discuss details of the wedding service in St Pauls. It must have been a bewildering time for the Princess as well, but even then, at the age of 20, her capacity for empathy and her very strong intuitive power ensured that any tension soon evaporated."
"I want to dwell for a moment on her public work, its cost and its meaning. After her marriage, the Princess joined her natural gifts of beauty, empathy and powerful intuition with that extraordinary charge which association with the Royal Family generates. We tend to be suspicious of public figures who wrap themselves in divinity and claim that their will is Gods will. But if noone can articulate in an unignorable way in the public realm the creative energy of the love that we see in Christ, then we shall find ourselves inhabiting a maimed and diminished society."
The Princess was still only 26 in 1987 when she shook the hand of a patient at the opening of the Middlesex Hospitals Aids ward. It was the first in the UK and it is very hard now to credit the degree of fear and prejudice which surrounded Aids in the80s. Those familiar with the field have no doubt that the Princess played a significant part in overcoming a harmful and even a cruel taboo.
"She proved the eloquence of embrace and of touch which, of course, have been used by royal healers throughout the centuries. She sought out places of suffering, because they are so very often places of truth where the masks have been removed. She was not afraid to be with the dying and to comfort them in an unsentimental way. And as she said, in her words, the biggest disease today is not leprosy or TB but the feeling of being unwanted."
Bill Deedes accompanied her on some of her visits. His response to the cynics was typically robust. He said she was one who sought above all to help vulnerable people in society.
"The role brought great power but, like any member of the Royal Family, she also experienced the weight of expectation and the intensity of the scrutiny. Honoring but managing the role and not allowing it to take over ones personal humanity is a desperately difficult task. As we have heard from Prince Harry, his mother Diana did all that she could to prepare her sons for the work which lies ahead."
"The love of Christ described in the lesson read by Prince William contains the essence of the spiritual life. Princess Diana recognized this quality of life in many of those, like John, whose lives she touched. It was a mystery which resonated deeply with her and for which she reached out."
"10 years after her tragic death, there are regular reports of fury at this or that incident. Let this service mark the point at which we let her rest in peace and dwell on her memory with thanksgiving and compassion. Let us also, echoing the words of Prince Harry, look to the future and pray for all those who serve our country as members of the Royal Family."
"French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner has a reputation for challenging convention and authority. A surprise appointment from the Socialist ranks to Nicolas Sarkozys conservative government, the founder of Medicins Sans Frontiers has always challenged convention. He said that France had to prepare for the possibility of war against Iran over its nuclear program. He also said that the world should be prepared for war with Iran."
"Kouchner is a humanitarian as well as a patriot, with a strong commitment to human rights. Unusually for a man of the Left, he supported the USled intervention in Iraq while criticizing the aftermath. But he did so on the grounds of Saddam Husseins denial of human rights, not his possible possession of weapons of mass destruction."
"His and President Sarkozys concern for human rights lies behind their eagerness to join Gordon Browns Britain in a new push for action in Darfur. Washington, which has been critical of some European states for their weakness in confronting Teheran, will have been delighted by his warning. How much should be made of his words on Iran remains unclear at this stage."
"Kouchner is making clear that France no longer takes the view once expressed by President Chirac that a nucleararmed Iran might be inevitable. On Iran he is, in a way, merely echoing the words of his President who declared in a speech last month that anucleararmed Iran would beunacceptable. Mr Kouchner became the first French Foreign Minister to visit Iraq since 1988, insisting that there could only be a political solution to the countrys problems, not a military one."
In continuing to ratchet up the rhetoric over that threat and to underline the Wests resolution on Irans nuclear enrichment program Mr Kouchner is supplementing his presidents warnings. Neither is saying that military intervention against Iran is imminent or inevitable. Neither has yet confirmed that France would be part of any such military action. Both are stressing the risks which are piling up as a result of Teherans brinkmanship.
"Für Elise was originally titled Bagatelle in A minor based on some handwritten notation a Beethoven researcher claimed to have seen on a nowlost copy of the sheet music. Bob Dylan wrote It Aint Me, Babe for Joan Baez."
"The 1975 song remains one of the most popular disco hits ever. Written for Billie Jean King, as a thankyou for a tracksuit she gave Elton. Some scholars speculate the song was actually written for Therese, as in Therese Malfatti, one of several women who turned down a marriage proposal from the notoriously lovesick maestro."
"The song was a reference to Kings pro tennis team, The Philadelphia Freedoms. Prior to 1968, tennis players were all considered amateurs and werent eligible to receive prize money. Billie Jean King fought against those constraints, ultimately founding Professional World Team Tennis in 1974."
"According to Rolling Stone, Lola was inspired by Candy Darling, a member of Andy Warhols entourage. But, in the Kinks official biography, Davies tells a different story. Candy came from out on the Island In the backroom she was everybodys darlin."
"He says Lola was written after the bands manager spent a very drunken night dancing with a woman whose five oclock shadow was apparently obvious to everyone but him. While the woman continues to remain a mystery, however, the phone number is all too real. In fact, its been wreaking havoc ever since 1982."
"Brown University adopted an 867 exchange number for its oncampus phone system. Room No. 5309 became a magnet for every drunk college kid with a 1980s fetish. The holder of 2128675309 put his phone number up for auction on eBay in 2004. Bids approached 100,000 before eBay pulled the item."
"Sedaka and King actually dated briefly in high school. Oh, Carol was a then top10 if now somewhat forgettable 1959 pop song. It inspired King to write a rebuttal entitled Oh, Neil. Sedaka was able to successfully milk the song's success."
"King and Goffin landed jobs at the legendary Brill Building pop music factory. The duo went on to write charttoppers like Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow and The LocoMotion. It Aint Me, Babe Written for Joan Baez, though it clearly wasnt the nicest gift Dylan could have given her."
"Dylan and Baez went on tour together in 1965. They had a huge fight and parted ways. Baez brought him flowers after he was hospitalized with a virus in May 1965. The two were together for a while, but soon broke up. They later married and had two children."
"In December 1968, Nash and Mitchell moved into a cozy little house in the Laurel Canyon section of Los Angeles. Though commonly left out of the hippy pantheon, Laurel Canyon was sort of a communehome away from San Francisco society for CSNY, Jim Morrison, the Eagles, Frank Zappa, and more."
"Our House was directly inspired by a lazy Sunday in the NashMitchell household. The couple went out to brunch, hit an antiques store, and then returned to find the house just a bit chilly. Nash literally lit a fire, while Mitchell placed the flowers in the vase that she bought that day. The whole tableau seemed so ridiculously domestic to Nash that he immediately sat down and spent the rest of the day writing about it."
"The cost to try to influence the 2008 election could exceed 3 billion. Just about every candidate running for an office from dogcatcher to president is spending the money. The costs to produce a TV commercial are no longer prohibitive for local and state candidates. In 2006, 2.3 billion was spent on political and issueadvocacy TV commercials."
Interest groups have spent 6.2 million on TV ads so far this year for state and local ballot measures. Subjects ranged from the Iraq war to telecommunications reform. Television ads on health care alone total 60 million.
"CMAG estimates more than 3 million of the 270 million spent to air issueadvocacy ads this year has gone for commercials in competitive House and Senate races. Up to now, the political commercials have been largely focused on the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. With 17 Democratic and Republican candidates running for president, more than 800 million will be spent on TV ads in the battle for the White House."
"Romney has aired his commercials more than 11,000 times this year at a cost of nearly 8.6 million. This is a record for the number of airings at this point in a presidential election cycle. In contrast, one of Romneys chief rivals, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, has spent nothing on television ads."
"Giuliani enjoys widespread national name recognition, while Romney does not. In the race for the Democratic nomination, Barack Obama has spent more than 2.3 million on television commercials. Hillary Clinton has spent 1 million less and leads in both national and early state polls. Bill Richardson has probably benefited the most in the Democratic contest."
"Romney is leading polls in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire. An American Research Group poll of South Carolina Republicans in August showed Romney registering at 9 percent. A month later, and with 350,000 worth of commercials aired in the two weeks leading up to the next poll, Romney was up 17 percentage points."
"Romneys latest ad began airing Friday in Iowa, and in it he vows to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. All of these issues should play well with conservatives who participate in the Iowa caucuses. While only a handful of Democratic candidates and Romney have used the airwaves until now, Tracey said he expects this to change. Before the end of October, I suspect all the frontrunner candidates will be on the air."
"In the fight for Congress, CMAG predicts that as much as 639 million could be spent on television advertising. Tracey noted that CMAGs 2008 election cycle forecast does not take into account unforeseen events such as former Florida Rep. Mark Foleys House page scandal."
"Voters will be numb after watching hundred and hundreds of ads, says Stuart Rothenberg. After a while, the ads just become lots of chatter, he says. An ad will have to be really good to cut through the noise, he adds. The sheer number of ads probably dilutes their importance."
"The OneTwoGo jet crashed in bad weather as it landed at Phukets airport on Sunday. Most of those killed were foreign nationals, and about 36 of the bodies still have yet to be identified. U.S. officials had previously confirmed that four Americans died in the crash, and one survived."
"Foreign Secretary David Miliband says eight British nationals are believed to have died. Thailands Public Health Minister Mongkol Na Songkhla said that of the 41 survivors who remain hospitalized, 38 were in stable condition and three in critical condition. Flight 269 was carrying 123 passengers and seven crew members when it left Bangkok for Phuket on Sunday."
"Buddhist, Christian and Muslim leaders gathered outside Phukets airport on Tuesday to remember those killed. For some families, DNA testing may be the only way to positively identify their relatives. The investigation into what caused the crash continues, but strong winds and rain are a suspected factor."
U.S. officials are aiding in the investigation because the aircraft was manufactured in the United States. Air traffic controller at Phuket airport said pilots were warned of possible wind shear. Airport officials said that the wind at the time of the crash was 17 kilometers an hour 11 miles an hour with stronger gusts. No planes were delayed or diverted because of the weather conditions.
"OneTwoGo is one of about 40 lowcost airlines operating in Asia. The industry will be watching closely for the results of the investigation into the crash. OneTwoGo officials would not speculate on what may have happened. But they did say their aircraft were regularly checked and maintained, and denied some media reports that questioned whether the discount airline employed more inexperienced pilots."
"Michael Moore and CNNs Sanjay Gupta argued Tuesday about Guptas report on Moores film Sicko Moore criticized a report Gupta did on CNN Monday on Sicko. He said the facts were fudged, Moore said, referring to Gupta, on CNNs Larry King Live."
"Both agreed, however, on the basic premise of Sicko Problems abound in Americas healthcare system and need to be fixed. ""I thought it was a good movie, and I wanted to say that, Gupta said."
" Gupta said he was concerned that the movie which notes that other developed nations such as France and Canada have universal health care suggests that health care in those countries is free. While patients may not pay for services at the doctors office, they do pay high taxes to fund such a system, he said."
"We America have a system built on profit, the moviemaker said. He asked Gupta if the current system, which requires him to receive approval from an insurance company before performing some procedures, is cumbersome to him. Its a shameful system, especially when Im dealing with some of my patients, Gupta said."
The problem is who we put in power. Moore has adamantly opposed the war in Iraq and said the government should reprioritize a position he took many years before skepticism of the wars success abounded in Washington. Some Democrats appear to be wavering on a highly contentious House resolution labeling Turkeys treatment of Armenians in World War I as genocide.
"Turkey is incensed by the resolution calling the killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks genocide. It threatened to block access to Incirlik Air Base after the resolution passed a House committee vote. The base, in southern Turkey near Syria, is a major resupply center for U.S. operations in Iraq and elsewhere in the Mideast and Asia."
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would bring the measure to a vote of the full House sometime next month. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer signaled Tuesday that the vote might be put off. Bush administration urged Congress to drop the issue. Some leading Democrats urged Pelosi not to bring it to the floor.
"Democratic Reps. Alcee Hastings and John Tanner urge Pelosi to reconsider. More than half of the cargo flown into Iraq and Afghanistan comes through Incirlik Air Base. Pentagon planners are looking at a broad range of options to keep food, fuel and ammunition flowing to U.S. troops in Iraq if Turkey blocks the air base, an official says. The House Armed Services Committee chairman announced his opposition to the resolution last week."
"Defense Secretary Robert Gates echoed lawmakers concerns last week. About 70 percent of all air cargo going into Iraq goes through Turkey. 95 percent of the MineResistant AmbushProtective vehicles, or MRAPs, are deployed in Iraq. About a third of the fuel that they consume go through Turkey or comes from Turkey."
"The U.S. military issued a warning order a few days ago to ensure that alternative air crews, planes, fuel and routes are lined up. Jordan and Kuwait are among the alternatives the United States is considering. Some fear pursuit of the resolution would also embolden the Turks to attack Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq."
"Incirlik offers 10,000 and 9,000foot runways and 57 hardened aircraft shelters. Globalsecurity.org: Incirlik has become a hub for cargo shipments to Iraq. It took over for RheinMain Air Base in Germany because it is closer to Iraq, reducing the strain on troops and aircraft, it says. The U.S. military says it has no immediate plans to pull troops out of Iraq."
"Mohammed stops at his cousins grave. ""I feel an ache when I think of her. Every time I remember her, I cry,"" he says. As he spoke, he poured water on a tree he planted next to it."
"The headstone reads Martyr 643, the child Hajer Ismael Khalil, 13 October 2006. Mohammed says, My cousin died on the scene. The same explosion cost him his leg and his childhood."
"My cousin was playing with her friend, he says. I remember the car was green. His mother, Jinan Khalifa, remembers that day all too well."
"There was shattered glass from the windows falling all over us. I went outside and saw my son covered in blood from head to toe, she says. Her son endured 11 operations before doctors amputated his leg below the knee."
"He stopped laughing, she says. It was tearing me up, Mohammed says. CNN first broadcast his story in May where it caught the attention of an American charity, the Global Medical Relief Fund."
"The Global Medical Relief Fund, a small charity based in New York, helps children of war and natural disasters. They have arranged for surgery and treatment at the Shriners Children Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."
Mohammed will arrive in the United States on Thursday afternoon. He will be fitted for a prosthetic leg in coming weeks. Montanti said her organization has a list of other young Iraqi children in need of help.
"The word needs to get out. It makes me cry with joy. I didnt think this act of human kindness would be presented to me, he says."
"When he comes back home, he wants to help rebuild Falluja, starting with his school. I will never leave school and, God willing, I will continue my education and become an architect and build all the schools, he says, standing on his crutches. He adds, I want to go to America and meet this person that gave me my future back."
"India has elected its first female president, official results show. Pratibha Patil, 72, is the ruling coalitions nominee for the mainly ceremonial post. Patil easily beat oppositionbacked challenger and vice president, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, in a vote by the national parliament and state politicians. This a victory of the people, Patil told reporters after official results were announced."
"Patil won about two thirds of the electoral college votes. She emerged on the national stage when the Congressled coalition and its communist allies failed to agree on a joint candidate. Supporters hoped Patils candidacy would help bring issues that plague women in India, like dowryrelated violence, into the public spotlight. For the first time we have a woman being elected president of India, Congress party leader Sonia Gandhi, Indias most powerful politician, said."
"Patil supporters took to the streets, singing and dancing as others lit fire crackers and beat large brass drums. A woman is murdered, raped or abused every three minutes on average in India. India has had a number of female icons in the past most famously Sonia Gandhis motherinlaw, Indira. But hope Patils presidency would spark only positive talk about womens influence in India evaporated when it emerged the bank for women she helped established was closed in 2003."
"The employees union has taken Patil and others to court, claiming loans meant for poor women were given to her brother. She was also accused of trying to shield her brother in a murder inquiry. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has dismissed accusations against her as mudslinging."
"She managed to offend many minority Muslims, and anger some historians. She claimed she had experienced a divine premonition that she was destined for higher office from a long dead spiritual guru. Critics also dug up a comment she was said to have made as Maharashtras health minister in 1975, saying people with hereditary diseases should be sterilized. More than 100 homes in an upscale San Diego community were evacuated after a landslide."
"Officials warned for at least two weeks that the ground was shifting beneath the hillside community along Soledad Mountain Road. Mayor Jerry Sanders declared a state of emergency, asking California and the federal government to help the La Jolla community recover from the Wednesday landslide. As of Thursday morning, he had already received offers of aid from legislators, the governors office and the White House."
"On Wednesday, a 20footdeep chasm opened beneath the road and homes. Holli Weld said she was walking her son to preschool when the street collapsed. Authorities told KGTV that most residents were at work and only seven people were in their homes."
"At least 111 homes were evacuated. Residents will be allowed to return to 75 of those houses by early Thursday morning. The asphalt that should be under my feet was 8 feet in the air, Russell Moore says. ""We watched the trees snapping and cracking and more boulders come down to our feet,"" he says."
"Several homes were damaged and at least one was destroyed, according to media reports. Nine homes are red tagged, meaning no one is allowed to enter them, and 27 more are yellow tagged. More than 2,400 customers were briefly left without electricity, but most residents had their power restored by Thursday."
"Deputy city engineer Robert Hawk told the UnionTribune that the hillside has slowly been slipping for years because the soil is unstable. Landslide incidents in the neighborhood date back to the 1960s, Hawk said. Mount Soledad is made up of weak layers of rock and that the culprit in the landslide is nature."
"Most of 103 children that a French charity attempted to take to France from Chad for adoption are neither Sudanese nor orphans. Six members of Zoes Ark were arrested last week as they tried to put the children on a plane to France. Three French journalists, a sevenmember Spanish flight crew and one Belgian were also arrested. Representatives of the journalists and flight crew said they were unaware of problems."
"Chadian President Idriss Deby hopes the journalists and the flight crew will be freed. The president would legally be able to intervene in the case if it is transferred from a judge in Abeche. The transfer will take place Monday, according to media reports. The charity said the children were Sudanese orphans that it was trying to rescue from a wartorn nation."
The children have been living in an orphanage in Abeche while authorities and aid agencies try to determine their identities. Chadian authorities immediately accused the charity of kidnapping the children and concealing their identity. Zoes Ark dressed the children in bandages and fake intravenous drips to make them look like refugees who needed medical help.
"The Spanish flight crew is innocent and should be released, a company executive says. The charity workers and journalists have been charged with kidnapping and extortion. They could face 20 years of hard labor if convicted. The Spaniards and Belgian are charged with complicity."
"Spains Foreign Ministry has publicly expressed its disagreement with the charges. The captain appealed urgently to be rescued, fearing the crew could be harmed or killed. The four women and three men are in good condition in custody, Cajal said. The detention is the first problem of its kind for the company, which hopes government negotiations can resolve the issue, he said. On its Web site, Zoes Ark describes itself as a nonprofit organization based in Paris."
"The Red Cross, UNHCR and UNICEF said the 21 girls and 82 boys range in age from about 1 year to about 10. The agencies said they have been interviewing the children individually to determine their backgrounds. The preliminary conclusion is that probably 85 come from Chadian villages near the cities of Adre and Tine along the ChadianSudanese border, the agencies said. Ninetyone children said they had been living with their family, consisting of at least one adult."
"Other French charities earlier had questioned whether Zoes Ark could legally arrange adoption of children from Darfur. French authorities have reacted angrily to the trip, calling the groups actions illegal and irresponsible. Reporters Without Borders said it will work for the release of the three journalists arrested in Chad. In response to the dispute in Chad, the Republic of Congo said late Wednesday it was suspending all international adoptions."
"Reporters Without Borders says photographers Marc Garmirian and JeanDaniel Guillou were on assignment for their news organizations. MarieAgnes Peleran of France 3 Miditerranee was traveling with the group in a personal capacity, though she carried a camera from her station, the group says."
"Dennis Schmitt found an island nearly two years ago near Greenland. The island was once thought to be a peninsula attached to Greenland by an ice shelf or a glacier. But such a large amount of ice melted, it revealed the distinct island."
"Many climatologists and scientists say arctic ice melt and other changes in the Earths climate are the result of an increase in the worlds temperature, a trend widely called global warming. He calls his discovery Warming Island. He told CNNs Anderson Cooper during a visit to the island earlier this year."
"Many global warming experts say the phenomenon, if unchecked, is capable of altering the worlds climate and geography. Other scientists and observers, a minority compared to those who believe the warming trend is something ominous, say it is simply the latest shift in the cyclical patterns of a planets life."
"The Earths temperature averages about 60 degrees Fahrenheit about 16 degrees Celsius. The average surface temperature has warmed one degree Fahrenheit 0.6 degrees Celsius during the last century. There are several possible reasons for the warming, scientists say."
"Greenhouse gases are in the atmosphere naturally and help keep the planets temperature at a comfortable level. The amount of carbon dioxide in the. atmosphere, for instance, has increased by 35 percent since the dawn of the industrial age. The presence of methane is now 151 percent above preindustrial levels, but the rate of increase has slowed in recent decades. Meanwhile, nitrous oxide increased by about 18 percent during the past 200 years."
"Many scientists and experts believe the increase is primarily the result of human activities, like the burning of fossil fuels, emissions from vehicles and the clearing of forests. For the last 30 years, theres no way theres anything natural that can explain it, Stephen Schneider, a professor of environmental studies at Stanford University in California, said. A vast bulk of the knowledgeable and honest community... will say the science is settled and humans are at least a majority of the reason behind the warming, he added."
"Weve suddenly taken to reading tea leaves, he said. When we saw cooling from 1940 to 1970, we were proclaiming global cooling. Since then, theres been a few tenths of global warming, so were proclaimingglobal warming. He believes the current warming trend is the result of natural variability."
"Lindzen says the way glaciers change and move are largely unexplained. Yet, for Schneider, it is a cause for concern and alarm. What were doing is cherry picking any event that occurs and then saying thats occurring due to global warming, he said."
"Were already in serious melt, nobody can explain it. The models dont predict it, he said. All we know is that we could be triggering something really nasty."
"The IPCC in February 2007 projected that if carbon dioxide levels doubled relative to preindustrial levels, temperatures could rise between 3.6 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit 2 to 4.5 degrees Celsius by 2100. Uncertainties, however, plague such forecasts, which are based on computer simulations and models."
"Crowds shouted God is great as they pulled the bruised, bulletriddled corpse through a dusty Mogadishu neighborhood. In a brutal echo of a 1993 battle involving Somali militias in which the bodies of U.S. troops were dragged through the streets, crowds Thursday shouted ""God is great"""
"The body was bound hand and foot with wire and wrapped in a sheet of plastic. Nine Ethiopians are reportedly part of the 19 dead. Another battle broke out on the citys south side Thursday morning between Ethiopian troops and insurgents. The fighting drove hundreds more people from their homes, on top of the tens of thousands aid agencies say have fled in recent weeks."
"Witnesses put the death toll from the days clashes at 19, including Ethiopian troops, insurgents and civilians. Ethiopian troops arrived in Somalia in December 2006 to help a weak Somali government drive the Islamic Courts Union out of Mogadishu. The Islamists responded by launching an insurgency against Somali government and Ethiopian troops that has lasted nearly a year."
"Stacy Peterson, 23, has been missing from her suburban Chicago home since October 28. Judge signs order to exhume the body of Drew Petersons third wife, who was found drowned in a bathtub in 2004. Peterson, 53, said he last spoke to 23-year-old Stacy Peterson  his fourth wife the night of October28."
"Drew Peterson initially told the media he believed his wife ran off with another man, but he hasnt repeated that accusation. The couple have been married four years and have two children, who have been interviewed for the investigation."
"Drew Peterson allowed a limited search on the night his wife was reported missing, but investigators were not allowed to look throughout the entire house. New information turned up during the investigation also raised questions about the death of Petersons third wife, Kathleen Savio, which was ruled an accident by a coroners jury. There are strong indications that it was a homicide, he said."
"Thats why we are doing the exhumation, because there are tests that need to be done that werent done during the first autopsy. Our main thrust is to determine whether or not it was a homicide, and as we do that, we will see if there is any evidence that implicates anyone."
"In 2002, Savio was charged once with battery and once with domestic battery against her husband, but was found not guilty at trial. Another time, she tried to bring domestic battery charges against Peterson, but no charges were ever filed."
"Its gonna look like an accident,  Doman said. I dont understand accidental drowning. You just dont drown in the bathtub, especially a small whirlpool."
"Friends and family of Stacy Peterson said she expressed concerns about her husband. A friend, Steve Cesare, has told CNN he received email from her describing her relationship as abusive. The womans aunt, Candace Aikin, of El Monte, California, said Stacy Peterson confided in her."
"Third seed Julia Vakulenko will face comeback queen Lindsay Davenport in the final. The Ukrainian battled through with a 61 46 75 victory over American qualifier Julie Ditty in the semifinals. The 24-year-old had previously twice lost at the lastfour stage this year in Las Vegas and Berlin. She was ""very, very full of stress and just not happy in her marriage at all,"" her coach said."
"Vakulenko squandered points for 53 leads in both the second and third sets. She reached a career high of 33rd in the world rankings back in May, but is now 36th. Davenport is seeking her second win in three tournaments since returning from a oneyear hiatus to have a baby. The 31-year-old is unseeded after accepting a wildcard to enter the Canadian tournament for the first time."
"The threetime Grand Slam winner has surged back up the rankings from 234th to 126th after winning her comeback tournament in Bali. The American has now beaten Zvonareva in all six encounters between the two players. I played well in the first set and had some chances early in the second set, but I didnt quite capitalize on them."
"There are lots of positives I can take from it, especially beating a really good player. I want to be the one on the offensive and not the defensive, and thats what Im going to try to do. I was trying to watch the first semifinal and see if that helped, but I play so much differently than Julie Ditty."
"Musharraf also suspended the constitution and dismissed the Pakistan Supreme Courts chief justice for the second time. On Sunday, police arrested the Javed Hashmi, the acting president of exPrime Minister Nawaz Sharifs opposition party. Hashimi was arrested when he stepped outside his house in the central city of Multan, AP reported."
"Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry was dismissed from his job. Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar was quickly appointed to replace him, according to state television. It was the second time the chief justice had been removed from his post. There was quick condemnation from within and outside his country."
"Two dozen policemen raid the offices of AAJTV in Islamabad. They say they had orders to take the stations equipment. The government also issued a directive warning the media that any criticism of the president or prime minister would be punishable by three years in jail and a fine of up to 70,000. His ousting by Musharraf in March prompted massive protests, and he was later reinstated."
"U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is in Turkey for a conference with Iraq and neighboring nations. The situation is just unfolding, Rice said. But anything that takes Pakistan off the democratic path, off the path of civilian rule is a step backward, and its highly regrettable."
"Musharraf was reelected president in October, but the election is not yet legally official. The Supreme Court is hearing constitutional challenges to Musharrafs eligibility. Under the constitution, Musharraf couldnt run for another term while serving both as president and military leader."
"The court allowed the election to go ahead, however, saying it would decide the issue later. Some speculated that the declaration of emergency is tied to rumors the court was planning to rule against Musharraf. Popular opposition leader Imran Khan says police surrounded his house in Lahore, barged in and told him he was under house arrest."
"Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto arrived in Karachi Saturday from Dubai, where she had gone to visit her family. Bhut to returned to Pakistan last month after several years in exile. She wants to lift her Pakistan Peoples Party to victory in Januarys parliamentary election in the hope she can have a third term as prime minister."
"The nations political atmosphere has been tense for months, with Pakistani leaders in August considering a state of emergency because of the growing security threats in the countrys lawless tribal regions. Musharraf, influenced in part by Rice, held off on the move."
The chief operating officer of the National Childrens Museum was arrested Tuesday. He is charged with distributing child pornography over the Internet. Singer is accused of sending images depicting child pornography to people he believed to be a 12-year-old girl. In reality he was communicating with an undercover detective for the New York Police Department.
"Singer, 49, was arrested at his home in Falls Church, Virginia, by federal agents. Authorities allege he engaged in several instant messaging chats and email communications with the undercover detective, posing as the woman and her daughter. Some of the pornographic images were sent from Singers computer at the museum, according to an affidavit filed in support of the charges."
"Singer is charged with five counts of distributing child pornography in interstate commerce. If convicted on each count, he would face a sentence of up to 140 years in prison. Singer allegedly initiated contact with the undercover detective, posing as the mother, in an America On Line chat room called Cuties. The chat room attracts people who are known to trade in pornographic images, including child pornography, an affidavit says."
"In his communications with the supposed daughter, Singer pretended to be a 15year-old boy, authorities said. In August 2007, he sent her two images featuring child pornography, according to the affidavit. Singer was expected to appear before a U.S. magistrate judge later Tuesday."
"He is identified in the complaint as a spokesman for the National Childrens Museum. He has been employed by the museum for four years, a spokeswoman says. The museum says it was notified by the Department of Homeland Security and ICE of Singers arrest."
"The museum, formerly known as the Capital Childrens Museum, has been closed to the public since 2004. It operates from administrative offices, the statement says. ""Harming children is against everything we stand for as an organization and as individuals,"" it says."
"Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, charged with videotaped rape of 2-year-old girl. Stiles was taken into custody Monday night after a Henderson, Nevada, police officer pulled over the white Buick Century he was driving. Prosecutors added a couple more charges before Wednesdays hearing, bringing the total to 23 felony counts. A new facility is being built and is scheduled to open in 2012."
"One of the lewdness charges stems from a 2004 incident, while the others are related to the videotape, the court said. Judge Deborah Lippis set November 19 as the date for the preliminary hearing. After the hearing, Stiles courtappointed attorney said his client was overwhelmed by the public opinion in the case."
"The girl, who is now 7, was found last month after a nationwide search. The girls mother said on The Dr. Phil Show Wednesday that she was relieved about Stiles arrest, although it would have been better if they found him dead. The woman said she will testify against Stiles if the case goes to court."
"Eight months pregnant, she said the incident has placed a lot of strain on her. Although she is in a relationship with a man her daughter calls Dad, she told McGraw, I dont feel comfortable leaving her with him, nor with anybody else."
Elaine Thomas says she lived in fear after seeing enhanced photos from the videotape on the local news. Thomas said she screamed when she recognized the photos on television and had no choice but to contact police about the man she had thought was a weapons enthusiast with only a minor criminal record.
"Former girlfriend Tina Allen says she thinks she is the reason Stiles came in contact with the girl. Allen said she took Stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived. Also living in the apartment were a family friend and her daughter, the alleged assault victim. That little girl suffered unimaginable things, and I knew for a fact it was him, Thomas said."
South African fast bowler Dale Steyn takes a careerbest five for 34. Steyns careerbest 534 was his fourth fivewicket haul in 14 tests. New Zealand were bowled out for 118 in reply to South Africas 226 and the home side reached 179 for two in their second innings.
Hashim Amla and Jacques Kallis shared an unbeaten stand of 159 as South Africa stretched their lead to 287. Former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming made 40 but the next best score was new cap Ross Taylors 15. Fleming was struck on the right forearm by Steyn and did not field during the afternoon.
"New Zealand, 41 for two overnight, lost nightwatchman Shane Bond, bowled by a Steyn yorker. Makhaya Ntini claimed the crucial wicket of Fleming, who was well caught by AB de Villiers diving to his left at third slip. Scott Styris and Taylor scraped 19 runs in 10 overs before more wickets tumbled."
"Ntini took three for 47 and Kallis two for 11. South Africa made an uncertain start to their second innings with openers Herschelle Gibbs and captain Graeme Smith out cheaply. The Kiwis were left to regret Brendon McCullums failure to hold a chance from Amla off Shane Bond, when the batsman had only scored two."
Lazing in a hammock is one of the best ways to spend a summer evening. What better way to declare the start of summer? The key to cutting off jeans is not to go too short too soon.
"Slip on the jeans and mark the desired length on one leg with chalk. Take them off, fold the leg at the mark, and iron the fold. Then cut just under the crease with fabric scissors."

"One in 5 students at the Shmisani Institute for Girls in Amman is Iraqi. Principal Sanaa Abu Harb makes an announcement over the speaker system. All Iraqi girls come outside now, she repeats several times."
"Jordan is allowing all Iraqi children regardless of refugee status to enroll in statefunded schools. The reason behind the jump in the number of Iraqis at the school is a new government policy. This school year, 145 students are Iraqi  roughly 20 percent of the students at this statefunded institution with another 40 Iraqi children on a waiting list."
"The move is cementing a massive population shift in the Middle East. More than 2.2 million Iraqis have fled the violence in their homeland. Jordanian Minister of Education Khalid Touqan says he expects Jordan to accommodate 40,000 to 50,000 Iraqi students this year."
"Harb, on the front line of the phenomenon, says the influx is putting a strain on her school. In a nearby neighborhood, in the study room of the Ahmed Toukan School for Boys, a handful of Iraqi kids talk of their experience living far from home. Seated at a rectangular table covered with a red and white tablecloth, the boys tell stories of horror and displacement."
"Eighteen-year-old Qutaiba lost five immediate family members before moving to Jordan to try to live a normal life. Most of the boys and young men from Iraq have missed several years of school up to a fouryear educational gap. All say, though, that they feel lucky to have gotten out, even if the violence in their country means always having to be on the move."
"The United Nations estimates up to 250,000 schoolage Iraqi children are in Jordan. ""I had friends in Iraq when I was small, I left them,"" he says."
"Fewer Iraqi families than first anticipated enrolled their kids in schools this year. The government extended the deadline for student applications and cut down on the required paperwork. According to the charity Save the Children, 21,000 Iraqi children have so far enrolled in Jordanian classrooms."
"The lower registration numbers were attributed in part to illegal refugees fears of being identified through their childrens school records. The population shift in the Middle East is, according to UNHCR head Antonio Guterres, the largest urban refugee situation in the world. About 10 percent of Jordans population is now made up of Iraqi refugees."
"Senate approves Michael Mukasey's nomination for attorney general by 5340 to 5340 vote. Mukaseys views on waterboarding threatened to derail the approval of President Bushs nominee to lead the Justice Department. He would replace longtime ally Alberto Gonzales, who resigned in September."
The nomination had been considered at risk after a number of Democratic senators opposed Mukasey because of questions that arose from his views on the terror interrogation technique known as waterboarding. Waterboarding is a technique that involves restraining a suspect and pouring water on him to produce the sensation of drowning. Two key Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee  said they would vote in favor of Mukasesy despite the controversy.
"The Department of Justice, once the crown jewel among government institutions, is adrift and rudderless, Schumer said Tuesday. It desperately needs a strong and independent leader at the helm to set it back on course and I believe Judge Mukasey is that person, he said. The committee voted 118 to send Mukaseys nomination to the Senate floor. Schumer said that in a meeting Friday the nominee said that Congress would be within its rights to pass a law that bans waterboarding across all government agencies."
"Judge Mukaseys pledge to enforce such a law rang hollow with Sen. Patrick Leahy, DVermont, the Judiciary Committees chairman. Unsaid, of course, is the fact that any such prohibition would have to be enacted over the veto of this president. But ranking Republican, Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, said he believed Mukasey would enforce a law banning waterboarding."
"A majority of Americans consider waterboarding a form of torture, but some of those say its OK for the U.S. government to use the technique. More than twothirds of respondents, or 69 percent, said yes 29 percent said no."
"58 percent say U.S. government should be allowed to use the procedure to try to get information from suspected terrorists. The CNNOpinion Research Corp. telephone poll of 1,024 American adults was carried out over the weekend and had a sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. Water flows from their taps for just three hours each evening."
"The mountain spring that supplies water to the town usually dries up at the end of summer, but just for a few days. This year it dried up early, on August 1, and hasnt revived. Every day at 6 p.m., Orme Mayor Tony Reames turns a big valve to release water from the towns tank."
"Cash, Georgia, could be the canary in the coal mine for the rest of the region. Just 150 miles to the southeast, the 4.5 million people who live in and around Atlanta are nervously watching water levels go down."
"The drought has highlighted an ongoing struggle between Georgia, Alabama and Florida over rights to water from the Chattahoochee River. Volunteers take turns three days a week driving a tanker truck or Ormes dieselbelching 1961 fire truck to a hydrant near Bridgeport, Alabama. Making several round trips, they haul about 25,000 gallons of water back to Orme each day."
"Bridgeport, which gets its water from the Tennessee River, doesnt charge its neighbor. Stevenson and New Hope, Alabama, also help out, occasionally bringing trucks full of water to the hydrant, where its transferred to the Orme trucks."
"An Austin, Texas, company called H2O Guard is planning to donate watersaving sink aerators, shower heads and toilet valves to everyone in Orme on November 17. We think were going to get another 90 gallons savings per day per household. Thatll make that little water tower in that town go from three hours to four hours without any change in anyones habits."
"Reames said residents have found creative ways to conserve, flushing toilets with condensation water from air conditioners and undrinkable water from swimming pools. China has suspended exports of the Aqua Dots toys contaminated with a chemical that can convert to a powerful date rape drug, Xinhua news agency reported."
The toys have caused some children who swallowed the craft toys to vomit and lose consciousness. U.S. safety officials voluntarily recalled about 4.2 million of the Chinesemade toys Wednesday. China suspended exports of the Aqua Dots toys that contain a chemical that converts into a date rape drug.
"Children who swallow the beads can become comatose, develop respiratory depression or have seizures. The artsandcraft beads have been selling since April at major U.S. retail stores under the name Aqua Dots. The Bindeez toys were recalled Tuesday after three children in Australia swallowed large quantities of the beads and were hospitalized. The beads have also been distributed in Australiaunder the name Bindeez Beads."
"A boy nearly 2 years old swallowed several dozen beads. He became dizzy and vomited several times before slipping into a comatose state. The commission said the toddler was hospitalized and has since fully recovered. In the United States, the CPSC said it has in recent days received two reports detailing the severe effects of the digested beads."
"The second incident involved a child who vomited, fell into a coma and was hospitalized for five days. It was not immediately clear whether the child had made a full recovery. The toy had been named toy of the year in Australia and recently crested WalMarts list of top 12 Christmas toys."
"WalMart on Thursday listed the toys on its Web site as out of stock online and had removed them from their top toy list as well. This latest recall is part of a larger batch of recalls of Chinesemade toys that have swept across the country. Last month alone, U.S. government safety officials and retailers voluntarily recalled at least 69,000 toys."
"Roads to Goma, about 10 miles from the camps, were crowded with refugees and local residents fleeing the fighting. Torrential rain made the movement even more difficult. The main road toward Sake was crowded with people we had difficulties getting through, UNHCR field safety adviser Pierre Nazroo was quoted as saying in the agencys release."
"Internally displaced people are moving from site to site, direction Goma. They have been living in extremely difficult conditions anyway. Now they have nothing but what they can carry. These are people in poor health they are soaking wet because of the torrential downpours."
"Congolese government accuses troops under rebel general Laurent Nkunda of staging the attack. A spokesman for the U.N. military mission in the Congo says it is uncertain which group attacked the outpost. The UNHCR says about 28,000 have abandoned the first three camps and about 2,000 had left Bulengo. The attack occurred near the village of Kishangazi, near the border with South Africa, the UNHCR says. It is unclear which group was behind the attack, a U.S. Embassy spokesman says."
"The UNHCR said 375,000 Congolese in North Kivu province have been forced from their homes in the past year. In the past two months alone, 160,000 have fled their homes amid the fighting between renegade troops and government forces, the agency said. North KIVu is in eastern Congo near the borders of Rwanda and Uganda. President Joseph Kabila has tried to gain a ceasefire with the rebels in the area under Nkunda."
"Wine Library TV host Gary Vaynerchuk discusses four spooky wine varieties for Halloween show. Of a wild and gamey red from Rioja, Spain, he says, Hit a deer on the road. Throw a bunch of cherries on it. Take out your knife, cut the deer."
"About 40,000 Internet viewers  many of them 20somethings  have a daily appointment with Wine Library TV. The lowbudget video blog is produced five days a week from a nondescript office in the threelevel wine retail operation that Vaynerchuks family owns in Springfield, New Jersey. Yet he stuffs his patter with sports and popculture references."
"The mission of wine sites like Wine Library TV, say several of the people behind these new outlets, is to demystify wine and in some cases, sell it, too. Using the language, attitude and new media that appeal to a young, techsavvy generation, they advocate trusting ones own palate rather than obeying powerful wine critics. Some of the sites also provide opportunities for average wine drinkers to share their opinions."
"Its about collecting thegood stuff as defined by someone elses palate and tastes. In the U.S., interest in wine is exploding. Were not afraid to be smartasses, he continues."
"The U.S. is projected to overtake No. 2 Italy by the end of 2007. Many of the new converts to wine are the socalled Millennials. One of the wine Web sites targeting a younger demographic is VineSugar.com, which features a blog called Wine Burps. The under30 age group coveted by beverage marketers is also called iGen, or the Internet Generation."
"VineSugar.com features rants about wine tasting fees, as well as interactive maps that plot and rate wineries. CellarTracker.com, an online wine community, appeals to more established wine collectors. The site provides free software designed by Eric LeVine, a fortuitously named former Microsoft software developer."
"Corkd.com already had 40,000 users when Vaynerchuk purchased the site last year. The free service allows users to catalog and review wines. Instead of having friends as on Facebook, members identify drinking buddies and check out what theyre drinking. The site counts 6 million bottles in their virtual cellars."
"In the growing presence of wine fans on the Internet  newbies as well as connoisseurs. Vaynerchuk sees a movement. Theyre part of forums, they meet up offline, he says. Its about bringing people together. Its all thats right about wine."
"On a recent rainy afternoon, Vaynerchuk barreled, unrehearsed and unscripted, through a 20minute show in a single take. He wrapped up Wine Library TV episode No. 337 with what has become his signature line."
"One in 5 students at the Shmisani Institute for Girls in Amman is Iraqi. All Iraqi girls come outside now, says principal Sanaa Abu Harb. Neil Edward Schlecht is a freelance writer based in Litchfield County, Connecticut."
"This school year, 145 students are Iraqi  roughly 20 percent of the students at this statefunded institution. Another 40 Iraqi children are on a waiting list. Harb wants the CNN crew to see how many Iraqi refugee girls her school is accommodating. The school is located in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul."
"Jordan is allowing all Iraqi children regardless of refugee status to enroll in statefunded schools. The move is cementing a massive population shift in the Middle East. More than 2.2 million Iraqis have fled the violence in their homeland, most of them seeking refuge in neighboring Jordan and Syria. Jordanian Minister of Education Khalid Touqan says he expects Jordan to accommodate 40,000 to 50,000 Iraqi students this year."
"Thats more than double the number of Iraqi children enrolled in public school two years ago. Harb, on the front line of the phenomenon, says the influx is putting a strain on her school. Even with some U.N. and U.S. aid to Jordan, theres still not enough money."
"Most of the boys and young men from Iraq have missed several years of school up to a fouryear educational gap that will delay their high school graduation. All say, though, that they feel lucky to have gotten out, even if the violence in their country means always having to be on the move, ready to live far from home and away from loved ones."
"Ziad Tarek Al Shamsi, 11, says it's not strange for him to be in the middle of people he doesn't know. But you have to miss your country, he says."
"The United Nations estimates up to 250,000 schoolage Iraqi children are in Jordan. Many of them are enrolled in private institutions. But as families run out of money they had when they left Iraq, they turn to public schools."
"About 10 percent of Jordans population is now made up of Iraqi refugees. Estimates range from 500,000 to 750,000 of them. The population shift in the Middle East is. according to UNHCR head Antonio Guterres, the largest urban refugee situation in the world. The lower registration numbers were attributed in part to illegal refugees fears of being identified through their childrens school records."
"Survivors of a storm that killed more than 3,000 people in the impoverished nation of Bangladesh grieved and buried their loved ones Monday. Iraqi children will be incorporated and integrated within our mainstream line of education, says Touqan, the education minister. We will not run a parallel system of education."
"The number of dead from Cyclone Sidr now at 3,114. The Bangladesh Red Crescent fears the death toll could be 5,000. In the fishing village of Galachipa, in Patuakhali district, Dhalan Mridha was grieving for family members who died."
"The Category 4 cyclone raked Bangladeshs southwest coast on Thursday with maximum sustained winds of 241 kmh 150 mph. On the way to a shelter, Mridha lost contact with his wife, mother and two children. The next morning he found their bodies."
"Thousands are still missing, while an estimated 280,000 others are unable to return to their homes. Many grieving families are now burying loved ones in single graves as no male members are available to dig them. Most houses in the region are made of flimsy materials such as bamboo and corrugated iron."
Bangladesh President Iajuddin Ahmed visited the devastated region Sunday. He handed out some aid to the crowds of people before members of the international media. It was seen largely a token effort as hundreds were left emptyhanded and furious. Lowlying Bangladesh is already prone to flooding which has wiped out the countrys rice production.
"International aid organizations promised initial packages of 25 million. U.S. has offered more than 2 million as an initial contribution for emergency relief. Nearly a million people died after massive floods wiped out the countrys rice production in 1974. In addition to the aid, an 18person Department of Defense medical team is in Bangladesh helping the estimated 15,000 injured by the storm. The U.N. Agency for International Development USAID is airlifting in relief supplies."
"Officials fear the scope of the destruction may be much more extensive since there are remote areas where conditions cannot yet be determined. Nearly a third of Bangladeshs 64 districts were affected by the cyclone, most of those along the southern coast. The Bangladeshi military is working to provide shelter for the many people who have been displaced. International aid groups including Save the Children, World Vision, and the Red Crescent are deploying resources."
"Roads to remote areas are either blocked by massive trees fallen by the storm. Clearing could take weeks in the remote areas because it must be done by hand. Along the broken road that leads into Kolapara, the body of an 8-year-old girl called Rummie was carefully carried away for burial."
World champions Italy clinch qualification for Euro 2008. Goals in the first and last minutes gave them a pulsating 21 victory at Hampden Park. Luca Toni shot Italy in front before Barry Ferguson levelled. Christian Panucci headed an injurytime winner after a controversial decision to award Italy a freekick. The result ends Scotland's hopes of reaching the finals.
Italy take the lead after just 70 seconds through Antonio Di Natale. Toni scores from close range after Gianluca Zambrotta's throw-in. France and Italy both qualify from Group B without playing a game. Scotland drop to second in Group B after 1-0 defeat.
Toni turned provider for Mauro Camoranesi who fired over from closerange. Toni then shrugged off two challenges before drawing a decent save from Craig Gordon with a wellstruck effort that the goalkeeper did well to block at the near post. Scotland were denied the opportunity to haul themselves back into the match when a thunderous drive from Lee McCulloch appeared to be handled by Zambrotta inside the area.
"Di Natale rifled the rebound into the back of the net. Scotland then produced some wonderful passing football, which culminated in a tightangled drive from Ferguson, but Gianluigi Buffon dived low to smother. Then came another scare for the home side. Gordon was forced to pull a save out of the top drawer to deny Massimo Ambrosini."
"Andrea Pirlo somehow managed to nod off the line to give Italy the lead. A freekick in a dangerous area provided Italy with the chance to start the second half as emphatically as they had started the first. Instead, it was Scotland who found the back of the net as Hampden erupted with 65 minutes gone. David Weir rose above everyone else in a packed box to meet Fergusons corner and his header appeared to be heading for the top corner."
"Scott Brown was withdrawn for Kenny Miller as Scotland went for broke. He was denied by Buffon, but the rebound fell kindly to Ferguson and the captain gratefully rifled home from closerange. Hutton appeared to be barged over in front of the corner flag but the referee inexplicably awarded the freekick the other way. Panucci rose to meet Pirlos cross and nod home the winner."
"Italy coach Roberto Donadoni said: ""The lads were fantastic. They worked so hard, they deserve this"" Qualifying for Euro 2008 is amazing after all that happened last week the death of the Lazio fan."
"This was a victory won with the heart. It was difficult to play in this stadium, with that atmosphere it was like a cauldron. We played really well and managed to win. In Italy we play a high level of football, weve won the Champions League and the World Cup but unfortunately at this moment we are being noticed for something else."
"The terror plot was unraveled after a weekend raid outside Baku that netted several suspected members of the radical group. U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack stressed that the details are still unfolding, and the threat may or may not be linked to the Saturday raid. Britain also shut its embassy in Baku to the public on Monday following security concerns nearby, Britains Foreign Office said.."
"There were some specific and credible threat information concerning the embassy. Several days ago, an Azerbaijani army officer who had connections to a radical Islamic group seized four assault rifles, a machine gun and 20 hand grenades from his military unit. Government security forces tracked down the group and arrested several members during a sweep on Saturday. One suspected member of the militant group resisted arrest and was killed in the sweep."
"The U.S. Embassy in Baku issued a warden message warning Americans in Azerbaijan to take precautions. There is no information at this time that other American or Western interests in Azerbaijan are being targeted. Azerbaijan is a former Soviet republic that borders the Caspian Sea, and lies just north of Iran."
"Novak Djokovic beaten in second round of Paris Masters by Fabrice Santoro. World No. 3 beaten in straight sets by 34-year-old Frenchman. Santoro beat world No. 2 Rafael Nadal in first round on Tuesday. He said he expects the embassy to limit its operations on Tuesday, as well."
Djokovic beats Roddick in straight sets. First time the two players had met. First outing since losing to David Nalbandian in Madrid Masters two weeks ago. Djokovic has already qualified for the seasonending Masters Cup and will now have extra time to prepare for the event in Shanghai starting next month. The 20year-old said he was struggling following dental surgery to remove two wisdom teeth.
"I didnt practise for a whole week, I only started practising two days ago. Physically, Im not feeling at all good. The result is a boost for rising British star Andy Murray, who earlier kept alive his hopes of an unexpected place at the Masters Cup. The 20-year-old beat Jarkko Nieminen of Finland 76 75 63 to progress into the third round."
"Murray won his second title this year at the St Petersburg Open last Sunday. He has not beaten Djokovic in three meetings so far but he has never played his unseeded next opponent Santoro. Ninth seed Haas, who has struggled with illness and injury this year, will play Djokovics compatriot Janko Tipsarevic in the second round. The Scot was broken just one point after having a winner overturned following an oncourt appeal, but he leveled immediately and then broke Nieminen again."
"Ivo Karlovic broke Roger Federer's serve for the first time in his life. The world number one progressed in a late match on Wednesday. Nikolay Davydenko beat Argentinas Juan Del Potro 76 73 61 in his opening match. The Russian, fined for lack of effort after his defeat by Croatian qualifier Marian Cilic in St Petersburg, will next face Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus in round three after Baghdatis shocked 13th seed Ivan Ljubicic."
"World numbet two Rafael Nadal also reached the third round after thrashing Italys Filippo Volandri 63 61. The Spaniard will next play Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland, who won by the same scoreline against 16th seed Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina. Lipstick outsold gloss by 76 million last year, and beauty companies are racing to launch new formulas."
"Hollywood pro Kara Yoshimoto Bua shows you how to apply lipstick perfectly. Dab some on immediately after getting out of the shower, when your lips are still a little moist. Condition and protect with a balm that contains sunscreen, like Softlips Raspberry with Green Tea SPF 20."
"A hydrating formula ensures a smooth coat of color. Try Neutrogena Moistureshine Soothing Lipsheers in Fresh Rose. Blot, reapply and blot again to remove excess oils and create a stain."
"Instead of tissues, use lintfree blotting papers, like Boscia Fresh Blotting Linens 10. Exfoliate before applying a bold hue like red or burgundy. Sally Hansen Gentle Peel for Rough Lips 10 uses fruit enzymes to remove dry patches."
"Define the borders of your mouth with a pencil to prevent color from bleeding. To avoid an unnaturally dark outline, use a shade thats lighter than your lipstick. Try Shu Uemura Kolinsky Portable Extra lipbrush 35 with Isadora Perfect Moisture lipstick in Bordeaux Red 11."

"Hormel Foods opened the museum in 2001 to the tune of almost 5,000 cans of SPAM. One of the main attractions is a scale model of a SPAM plant, where visitors can don white coats and hairnets while pretending to produce tinned meat. Its pretty hard to argue with the motto Any Day Above Ground is a Good One."
"The National Museum of Funeral History opened in 1992. Visitors are treated to exhibits that include a Civil War embalming display and a replica of a turnofthecentury casket factory. In addition, the museum boasts an exhibit of fantasy coffins designed by Ghanaian artist Kane Quaye.

"The Hobo Museum in Britt, Iowa, details the history and culture of tramps. The museum is only open to the public during the annual Hobo Convention. Lodging is available all over the area, but its a safe bet that most of your compatriots will be resting their floppy hats at the hobo jungle. The Hobo Foundation also oversees the nearby Hobo Cemetery, where those who have caught the westbound are laid to rest."
"The Mütter Museum is a medical museum in Philadelphia. It was built by the College of Physicians of Philadelphia to educate medical students. Today, it's a popular spot for anyone interested in the grotesque. There, youll find the worlds largest colon, removed from a man who died of constipation."
"The P.T. Barnum Museum is located in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Some visitors will appreciate the museums ridiculously detailed miniature model of a fivering circus. But only circus freaks will get a kick out of seeing a stale piece of cake from the wedding of Barnums 40inchtall sidekick, General Tom Thumb."

"The Science Museum of Minnesota has a collection of 19thcentury phrenology machines and 1970s breast enlargers. At Cooks Natural Science Museum in Decatur, Alabama, visitors can learn everything they ever wanted to know about rats, cockroaches, mice, spiders, and termites. What began as a training facility for Cooks Pest Control exterminators blossomed into one of the few museums in the country willing to tell the tale of the pest."
"The Vent Haven Ventriloquist Museum was the brainchild of the late William Shakespeare Berger. He founded the site as a home for retired wooden puppets. In fact, he collected figures from some of the countrys most famous ventriloquists. The museum is located in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky."
"The Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority CRRA turns garbage into 6,500 square feet of pure recycling entertainment. T. our the Temple of Trash or visit the oldfashioned town dump. Mom wasnt kidding when she said one mans trash is another mans treasure. But sadly, when Berger gave the tour, you could totally tell his mouth was moving."
"Interpol appeals for help to identify a man from digitally reconstructed photos taken from the Internet. Interpol said the images showed him sexually abusing underage boys. This moving image shows how police used software to unscramble the image. And for your recyclerintraining, head across the state to the Childrens Garbage Museum."
"The pictures have been on the the Internet for several years, but investigators have been unable to determine the mans identity or nationality. Interpol has determined the photos were taken in Vietnam and Cambodia. Without the publics help this sexual predator could continue to rape and sexually abuse young children whose ages appear to range from six to early teens, says Interpol Secretary General Ronald K. Noble."
"The decision to make public this mans picture was not one which was taken lightly, said Kristin Kvigne, assistant director of Interpols Trafficking in Human Beings Unit. In October 1851 Paul Julius Reuter, a Germanborn immigrant, opened an office in the City of London which transmitted stock market quotations between London and Paris."
"18 months earlier he had used pigeons to fly stock prices between Aachen and Brussels, a service which operated for a year until the gap in the telegraph link was closed. Reuters, as the agency soon became known, eventually extended its service to other European countries. It also expanded the content to include general and economic news from all around the world."
"In 1883 Reuters began to use a column printer to transmit messages electrically to London newspapers. In 1923 Reuters pioneered the use of radio to transmit news internationally. Today Reuters has over 16,900 staff in over 94 countries across the globe. In 2006 Reuters filed over two and a half million news items, including 656,500 alerts, from 209 countries around the world."
"Six of the seven college students killed in a house fire in North Carolina attended the University of South Carolina. This is a very sad day for the university family, a university official says. Some 370,000 financial market professionals working in the equities, fixed income, foreign exchange, money, commodities and energy markets around the world use Reuters products."
"The seventh fatality is believed to be a Clemson University student. The six survivors  who were treated and released from Brunswick Community Hospital are also USC students. It is difficult to ascertain exactly who was in the house and who was not, Pruitt said."
"Newspaper deliveryman Tim Burns was aghast when he first saw the inferno early Sunday morning. He tried to approach the door but the flames were too intense, he said. The USC students were affiliated with the Delta Delta Delta sorority and the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity."
"It just so happens, as on many university campuses, that certain sororities and certain fraternities hang around together, he says. One person described as unaccounted for was later confirmed dead, Ocean Isle Beach Mayor Debbie Smith says. ""We suffered a terrible tragedy at Ocean Isle this morning,"" she says."
"The mayor said one of the 13 people in the house was related to the houses owner. She said the house had working smoke detectors. Officials are investigating the cause of the fire, Smith said. The fire department arrived on the scene about five minutes after the fire department was notified."
"The University of North Carolina student was staying at a house about 100 feet away. ""The ash and the smoke were coming down on us. We were just trying to get away,"" he says."
"Concerned citizens have helped troops improve security in parts of Baghdad, official says. People line the streets, cars congest them, trash collectors and other city workers have returned. Army Col. Don Farris: Al Qaeda in Iraq presence has been crushed since the beginning of May. The 7milelong islands yearround population is about 425, while the summer season population is 25,000."
"Pentagon spokesman: Surge, additional U.S. troops contributed to improving security situation. Also helping improve the security situation are the ceasefire by radical Shiite cleric Muqtada alSadrs Mehdi Army, he says. However, there are still dangers, most notably the threats posed by Iranianbacked Shiite militants, Farris says."
"Some of those citizens are members of local Sunni awakening councils, comprised of former militants. They create neighborhood watch groups to root out the insurgent elements in an area. Especially in the last six weeks, Farris said, civic and religious leaders have seen outsiders operating in the area and troops have made arrests, two Iranian operatives among them. ""I can only speak to what I see in my sector and I am encouraged,"" he said."
"Many of the communities in his area have been wracked with sectarian warfare and terrorized by insurgents and death squads. Despite improvements in the security situation, Farris warned that we still have a lot of work to do. There are intelligence reports indicating weapons and money are still flowing into Sadr City."
"There are also problems returning refugees and displaced people to their homes in the area, Farris said. Essential services like water and electricity are not yet up to snuff, he said. Farris' remarks echo a string of similar assertions made by U.S. and Iraqi military officials over recent weeks. The military officials say they are seeing signs of SunniShiite reconciliation."
"Officials are searching for the driver of a white truck seen on Santiago Canyon Road on Sunday, near the time the Santiago fire started. These people are not suspects at this time, Orange County Fire Authority Chief Chip Prather said. Brig. Gen. Ed Cardon, deputy commander for support of MultiNational DivisionCenter, discussed a definite period of progress in his region on the southern Baghdad outskirts."

"The Santiago fire, now 27,000 acres and still burning, was deliberately set, officials said Thursday. Several mandatory evacuations remain in place for the Santiago fire. The fire has destroyed 14 homes and various other structures."
"Authorities also suspect arson in the Rosa fire in San Diego County. Catalino Pineda is one of five people who have been arrested in arson investigations this week. None of them has been linked to the major wildfires raging across Southern California, police say. The Los Angeles County District Attorneys Office filed arson charges against a 41-year-old Sun Valley man."
"The witnesses followed Pineda to a nearby restaurant and called police, who arrested him. He is charged with one count of arson of a structure or forest. He faces up to six years in prison if convicted."
"In San Bernardino, east of Los Angeles, John Rund, of Hesperia, was arrested Wednesday on arson charges. A witness reported seeing him in brush near the starting point of a fire Tuesday. That fire was quickly put out by passersby."
"A statement from the office did not say when or where Riperti is accused of setting a fire. He is being held on 250,000 bail. In San Diego County, the sheriffs department this week arrested an adult and a juvenile."
"Investigators have determined that the Grass Valley fire in San Bernardino County was not caused by arson. More than 1,600 homes have been destroyed in the past week by Southern California wildfires. The partnership started as a single shop on Oxford Street in London, opened in 1864 by John Lewis. Today the partnership is an organization with bases throughout the UK, with supermarkets and department stores."
"Every Partner receives the same scale of bonus, based on a fixed percentage of their annual wage. Chairman Sir Stuart Hampson retired at the end of March 2007, his successor is Charlie Mayfield. John Lewis consolidated revenue for the last financial year was 11.4 billion."
"The company was founded in 1985 by seven communications industry veterans. Today, Qualcomms patent portfolio includes approximately 6,100 United States patents and patent applications for CDMA and related technologies.

Qualcomm is among the members of the SP 500 Index, Fortune 500, and a winner of the U.S. Department of Labors Secretary of Labor Opportunity Award."
"The girl has been found and is safe, officials in Nye County, Nevada, say. Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, is being sought as a suspect, police say. Qualcomms Annual revenue for 2006 was 7.53 billion, with a net income of 2.47 billion."
"The girl, now 7, was shown in a sex video made four years ago, police say. She was found Friday with family in Las Vegas after thousands of tips poured in. The detectives say she is in good condition, Nye County Sheriff Tony De Meo says."
"A former Las Vegas animal trainer, Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, has been identified as a suspect and is being sought in the case. Stiles is a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, about 60 miles west of Las Vegas."
"Stiles was a distant friend of the girls family, De Meo said. Someone close to Stiles has told investigators that Stiles is a survivalist type and always carries a weapon, Nye County District Attorney Bob Beckett said."
"The FBI is also seeking Stiles on state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under the age of 14. There appeared to be physical similarities between Stiles and the man in the videotape, De Meo says. ""Nothing that I have seen in my career comes close to what this girl has gone through,"" he says."
"Nevadan Darren Tuck recently gave police the videotape, saying he found it in the desert. Police said the tape was in his possession at least since May before he handed it over to authorities. He is being sought on a parole violation for failure to pay child support. Tuck faces a possible 10yearstolife sentence for exhibiting pornography."
"Harry Kuehn, Tucks attorney, said this week on CNNs Nancy Grace that Tuck was racked by indecision about what to do with the tape once he realized what it was. Hes previously dealt with the sheriffs office in Nye County it was previously unsatisfactory, the attorney said. They say a lot of artistic expression is motivated by selfloathing. But not for these folks!"
"Alfred Hitchcock was, without question, one of the towering geniuses of cinema. And, like many greats, he wasnt exactly the best collaborator. Heres to the creative types who managed to raise egotism to an art form."
"Hitchcock was particularly trying for screenwriters, who felt he never properly credited them for their work. But he was notoriously hard on actors. He was once quoted as saying, Actors are cattle  a quip that stirred up a huge outcry."
"Ayn Rand born Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum is the patron saint of Thinking Youre Better Than Everybody Else. Her most famous novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, are massive dramatizations of Objectivism, her selfspun OscartheGrouch philosophy for success. Objectivism champions ego and accomplishment, shuns all religion as folly, and condemns any form of charity or altruism as counterproductive to society."
"Not surprisingly, she saw humility as a weakness and regarded laughing at yourself as spitting in your own face. With signature modesty, she ranked herself as the philosophical equal of Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas. When you create a cinematic masterpiece such as Citizen Kane at the ripe old age of 25, youre bound to get a big head."
"But Welles was convinced of his own importance much earlier than that. Citizen Kane might have been sparked by nothing more than a bruised ego. After the unparalleled success of Citizen Kane, Welless arrogant side didnt get any less subtle. Track down a recording of Welles outtakes for a TV commercial for frozen peas."
"Frank Lloyd Wright is arguably the genius of 20thcentury architecture. He was notorious for believing he was superior to mere mortals. Wright is behind the Robie House, Fallingwater, Taliesin West, the Guggenheim, and countless other design benchmarks."
"In 1935, department store magnate Stanley Marcus of NeimanMarcus fame commissioned the architect to design his Dallas home. Wrights avantgarde floor plan included sleeping porches that required his client to sleep outdoors yearround. In addition, Marcus small bedroom cubicles came equipped with almost no closet space."
"When Stanley respectfully explained that a temperatures during summer nights in Dallas often exceed 80 degrees, Wright threw a series of tantrums. Fortunately for the voyeur in us all, said tantrums usually took place in letter form. Preserved and occasionally displayed at the Dallas Museum of Art, they make for delicious reading."
"The legendary Surrealist painter was known to walk the streets of New York City clanging a hand bell. Criticized for choosing to live under General Francos fascist government in Spain, Dalí defended his position by stating that he didnt care about others so long as he could be king. Not exactly a man of the people."
"At the age of 6 years, I wanted to be a chef. At the age Of 7, I Wanted to be Napoleon. My ambitions have continued to grow at the same rate ever since."
"The vaudeville singer, actor, dancer, and comedian was born Asa Yoelson in Seredzius, Lithuania, in what was then part of Imperial Russia. As a performer, he was known for hijacking the action in the middle of shows, adlibbing, or just stopping to talk to the audience. During a 1911 performance of the critically hated Paris is a Paradise for Coons title, Jolson stopped and asked the audience if theyd rather hear him sing than see the rest of the play."
"From that moment on, no one else could share the stage with him. According to most contemporary accounts, he actually was the greatest in the world. Despite the enormity of his contributions to stage and screen, Jolsons legacy has become a political hot potato because of his use of stage blackface."
"AC Milans Brazilian midfielder Kaka has been named European player of the year, lifting France Footballs Ballon dOr award. His success comes two years after his fellow countryman, Barcelonas Ronaldinho, claimed the award. The 25year-old Kaka was a major factor in AC Milans triumphant Champions League campaign."
"The runnerup was Manchester Uniteds Portuguese winger Cristiano Ronaldo with Barcelonas Argentinian midfielder Lionel Messi finishing third. This is very special for me  it culminates an astonishing year for me, Kaka said. At 25 years old, he has already won all the games major prizes, individually and collectively."
"He was part of Brazils 2002 World Cup winning squad, although he was limited to just 19 minutes as a substitute against Costa Rica. He was top scorer in last seasons Champions League, helping Milan to avenge their loss to Liverpool in the 2005 final. He won the Italian domestic title in his first season at Milan having joined from Brazilians Sao Paulo for 8.5 million."

"Six University of South Carolina students and a Clemson University student died in the fire early Sunday morning in Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina. Six other students were able to get out of the house in time. Authorities from the state Bureau of Investigation and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are leading the investigation."
"It could be as much as a month until investigators know the cause of the fire. Fire officials do not believe foul play was involved. The identities of the victims have not yet been confirmed, a University of South Carolina official says."
"The university did not cancel classes on Monday, but arrangements had been made for those who need to go home or stay out of class. Pruitt said meetings had been held Sunday with members of Delta Delta Delta sorority and Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. The South Carolina students were affiliated with those houses, he said, although he stressed that the weekend was not an official Greek function."
"Jay Laura, student president of the USC chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, says the campus will pull together. Tripp Wylie, a 20-year-old South Carolina sophomore, said he jumped out of a thirdstory window into a canal to escape the flames. ""I could see a buddy of mine off to the left who had gotten out,"" he said."
"The smoke was pouring out, couldnt really breathe, so I had to make a quick decision. I just kind of leaned out the window and luckily I jumped far enough to make it into the canal. Neighbors flocked to see the fire as firefighters battled and ultimately got the blaze under control."
"The whole house was completely engulfed in flames, up to about 20 feet, he said. Linda Sing said she was walking her dog when she saw the fiery destruction. George Smith said the houses occupants were partying in there yesterday and into the night."
"She noted that firefighters had saved an adjacent house by spraying it down with water. This is the worst thing Ive ever seen. Weve had hurricanes, but this is worse."
"MI5 chief says children as young as 15 are becoming involved in terrorist activity. At least 2,000 people in Britain pose a threat to the countrys security. Terrorists are radicalising, indoctrinating and grooming young, vulnerable people to carry out acts of terrorism, he says. The yearround population of the 7milelong island is about 425, but swells to about 25,000 during the summer season."
"Evans said the figure of 2,000  only included those the intelligence services knew about. He said there had been 200 terrorist convictions in Britain since the September 11 attacks. MI5 head added that over recent years much of the command and inspiration for attack planning in the UK had come from al Qaedas remaining core leadership in the tribal areas of Pakistan."
"There is no doubt that there is training activity and terrorist planning in East Africa, Evans says. resources that could be devoted to counterterrorism are instead being used to protect Britain against spying by Russia, China and others. There had been no decrease in the number of Russian covert intelligence officers operating in Britain since the end of the Cold War, he says."
"Some opponents of immigration, even the legal kind, fear changes in local culture. They always take the low road and harken back to the nativism that greeted earlier waves of immigrants. The restrictionists insist that what bothers them are merely practical concerns that our borders arent secure, that so many immigrants are coming into the country illegally."
"In Cooperstown, N.D., locals opposed efforts to bring in a hog plant and a dairy, because those kind of dirty and hard jobs are likely to attract American kids who work at Starbucks. The article quotes Orville Tranby, a local community leader in Cooperstown. He says that some residents have told him face to face that such facilities might attract Hispanic immigrants who could change the local culture."
"A local library employee came up with the radical idea of a bilingual story time. Townspeople wanted no part of that. They demanded that all books purchased by the library, or even donated, be in Englishonly."
"The perception that the country is becoming more Hispanic, that Spanish is replacing English, and that Hispanic immigrants are weakening American identity. A leader of the vigilante Minuteman movement moronically called it the colonization of the United States. This sort of rhetoric is all about fear  that those who thrive in the dominant culture are losing their primacy, that the mainstream is being polluted by foreigners. It conjures up the alarm bells that Benjamin Franklin set off about German immigrants in the late 18th century."
It popped up in the mid19th century amid worries that Chinese immigrants were unassimilable. And it helped welcome the 20th century when Massachusetts Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge warned that immigrants read the Irish were diluting the quality of U.S. citizenship. Where have we heard that before? And when will we hear it again?
Mauro Camoranesi scored with 13 minutes left to earn Juventus a 11 home draw with Serie A leaders Inter Milan. Ruben Navarrette Jr. is a member of the editorial board of the San Diego UnionTribune and a nationally syndicated columnist.
"Julio Cruz gave Inter the lead against Juventus in the 11th minute. Camoranesi saw his shot deflect off defender Walter Samuel. The result means Inter retain their unbeaten record this season. The defending champions are now two points clear of Fiorentina at the top of the table, with Roma a point further behind and Juventus in fourth place. Patrick Vieira, Francesco Toldo, Marco Materazzi and Dejan Stankovic were all ruled out."
"Roma throw away a twogoal lead to draw 22 at Empoli. Siena snatched a share of the spoils from Parma in a 22 draw. Napoli needed an injury time goal from striker Ezequiel Lavezzi to deny rockbottom Reggina their first win of the season. One Australian soldier, three civilians and Taliban militants were killed early Friday during heavy fighting in southern Afghanistan, according to information from Australian and NATO officials. The Australian soldier was killed during heavyFighting in southernAfghanistan."
"Luke Worsley of Sydney served with the Special Operations Task Group. This is the fourth Australian troop to die in the Afghan conflict. The incident occurred in Tarin Kowt in Uruzgan province, the Australian Defence Ministry said."
"The SOTG was conducting an operation to clear an identified Taliban bomb making facility in Uruzgan province, when the soldier was hit by small arms fire. Taliban insurgents initiated the firefight which lasted several hours. ISAF spokesman said it is not known how the civilians, two women and a child, died. However, the insurgents fired upon ISAF soldiers from the compound in which the Afghan civilians were found after the fight."
"18-year-old shot eight people inside his high school in southern Finland, before turning the gun on himself. Police confirmed the dead numbered two girls, five boys and the schools headmistress. The shooting appeared to have been planned out in graphic videos posted on Internet filesharing site YouTube, police said."
"Police identify the shooter as Pekka Eric Auvinen. He took his own life, police say. Ten other people were taken to a hospital with minor injuries. It was the first school shooting in Finland since 1989."
"Auvinen published a manifesto online demanding war on the weakminded masses. YouTube appeared to have removed 89 videos linked to his account, many of them featuring Nazi imagery. Finnish media reported someone posted a message two weeks ago, warning of a bloodbath at the school."
"A video posted earlier Wednesday, by Sturmgeist89, was titled Jokela High School Massacre  1172007. The video showed a picture of the school, which then disintegrated to reveal two images of Auvinen against a red background, pointing a gun at the screen. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the students behind the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, also cited that groups lyrics."
"Another short video clip, called Just Testing My Gun, showed Auvinen loading and cocking a handgun. He fired and hit several pieces of fruit in a wooded area the camera then showed a closeup of the destroyed fruit, and then a fullscreen shot of him again. The site indicated that the youth appeared to be fascinated with killing."
"Many showed victims being wheeled away or people running for their lives. Throughout all of this, the single word DIE constantly flashed across the screen. In the rambling text posted on the site, Auvinen said that he is a cynical existentialist, antihuman humanist, antisocial socialDarwinist and godlike atheist."
"Police say they were fired at when they arrived at the school. They described the scene as chaotic, with some of the 460 students, ranging in age from 12 to 18, breaking windows in an attempt to escape. When the polices special SWAT unit entered the high school they found the gunman unconscious and in critical condition in the lower lobby of the building. Police assume he tried to take his own life as no officers fired at him."
"Several bodies were also found in the same location, where the shooting is believed to have begun. Police also said that the gun Auvinen used, which was fully licensed, had been purchased less than a month ago on October 19. He had a recommendation from a shooting club when he obtained the gun, police added."
"Finland, which enjoys a strong tradition of hunting, has a high proportion of gun ownership. Two million firearms owned in a nation of only five million. Teacher Kim Kiuru described how the headmistress used the public address system to tell pupils to stay in classrooms. He said he locked his classroom door, then waited in the corridor for more news."
"France coach Raymond Domenech has omitted striker David Trezeguet from his squad for this months friendly against Morocco and the Euro 2008 qualifier against the Ukraine. Kiuru said that he saw a womans body as he fled the school, before telling his pupils to leave the building through the windows."
Trezeguet has scored scored 10 goals in 11 Serie A matches for Juventus this season. The 29-year-old last played for France in the 10 home defeat by Scotland in September. He was furious after being dropped for the games against Lithuania and the Faroe Islands. He played no part as Domenechs team overtook the Scots at the top of Group B with comfortable victories last month.
"Domenech has again included young Lyon forward Hatem Ben Arfa. Captain Patrick Vieira is ruled out due to injury, but the Inter Milan midfielder will join up with the squad anyway. Karim Benzema is joined in the squad by clubmate Nicholas Anelka, who is still recovering from an injury. Domenech hopes David will help Juventus win the Italian league title."
"France face the Moroccans on November 16 and then travel to the Ukraine on November 21. Domenechs team will qualify for the finals if Italy beat Scotland at Hampden on November 17. If the Glasgow game ends in a draw, France will need at least a point in Kiev to book their ticket."
"Polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs tried to hang himself earlier this year while he was in jail awaiting trial, according to court documents unsealed by a Utah judge on Tuesday. France squad: Goalkeepers M Landreau, S Frey Fiorentina, U Rame Bordeaux. Defenders E Abidal Barcelona, P Evra Manchester United, W Gallas Arsenal, B Sagna Arsenal, L Thuram Barcelona, S Squillaci Lyon, F Clerc Lyon. Striker N Anelka Bolton, H Ben Arfa Lyon, K Benzema Lyon, T Henry Barcelona, F Malouda Chelsea, F Ribery Bayern Munich."
"Warren Jeffs, the leader and socalled prophet of the 10,000member Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, is now awaiting sentencing. Jeffs was convicted on two counts of being an accomplice to rape. Documents indicate that Jeffs confessed to immorality with a sister and a daughter more than 30 years ago. On January 28, the report said, he attempted to hang himself in his cell."
"In the days following the suicide attempt, while he was on suicide watch, Jeffs on separate occasions threw himself against the wall and banged his head on the wall. Jail transcripts show that Jeffs suicide attempt came three days after a visit with his brother."
"The day before that, Jeffs told a follower in a phone conversation that he was covered with immorality with a sister and a daughter when I was younger. Jeffs defense attorneys, who argued against the release of the documents, said in a motion opposing the unsealing of the statements that Jeffs recanted them the following month."
"Jeffs, 51, was convicted in September of being an accomplice to rape. He was accused of using his religious influence over his followers to coerce a 14yearold girl into marriage to her 19yearold cousin. He faces a sentence of up to life in prison when he is sentenced November 20."
"Jeffs was on the FBIs 10 most wanted fugitives list when he was arrested in August 2006 outside Las Vegas, Nevada. Critics say that inside the FLDS, marriages are arranged for girls as young as 13. If male followers are excommunicated, critics claim, wives and children can be reassigned."
"Two of his followers who spoke to CNN said they do not believe he made the statements. He is a perfectly priestly man, said a woman who identified herself as Cathy. Her husband, Patrick, told CNN, Its hogwash."
Lewis Hamilton spun out of the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai. The Briton saw his 12-point title lead cut to four by Fernando Alonso. The world title race goes to a cliffhanger finale in Brazil on October 21. Hamilton can still clinch the crown with third place in the closing race.
"The Spaniard finished second behind Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen, who also kept his title hopes alive by moving within seven points of Hamilton. The young Briton started the race in pole position and at one stage led Raikkenson by more than eight seconds as he again showed superb skills in the wet conditions. However, the 22-year-old stayed out on the drying track too long in his wet tires, which deteriorated at an alarming rate. Hamilton spun out onto the gravel to end his chances with 25 laps to go."
"Raikkones teammate Felipe Massa was third, while fourth place was claimed by Toro Rossos Sebastien Vettel. Hamilton was last week reprimanded for causing an accident in Japan behind the safety car while Hamilton was cleared of any wrongdoing. Jenson Button was fifth in a Honda ahead of Vettels teammate Vitantonio Liuzzi. Nick Heidfeld was seventh for BMW Sauber and David Coulthard of Scotland took the final point for Red Bull."
We were having a great race and we didnt know if it was going to rain or not. The tyres were getting worse and worse and you could almost see the canvas underneath. But I am over it and we look forward to Brazil.
 McLaren boss Ron Dennis refused to blame his driver or his team for the spinoff. It has been a very competitive season between our drivers and it will go on for another Grand Prix. I dont think we did anything dramatically wrong and neither did Lewis.
"Alonso is seeking to become the third driver to win three world titles. The Spaniard qualified for the race in fourth place on the grid. He said: ""The circuit was considerably drier than the pit lane entrance. Thats what made the difference"""
The result was good today and the eight points are a help for sure. I think the championship will still be very difficult because I know it will not be easy to take four points from Lewis. I need something dramatic if I want to win. With a normal race it will be impossible.
CNN will be hosting three events looking at modern strategies in todays business arena.

"Sheikh Mohammed bin Isa Al Khalifa is the chief executive of the Economic Development Board. He is concerned the nuclear dispute with Iran is deterring potential investors. The governments pushing ahead with economic reforms to reduce the Kingdoms dependence on oil. But with crude prices near 100 a barrel, John Defterios asked whether the appetite for change had diminished."
"The reforms are being done for aspirational reasons rather than necessity. Traditionally its been a financial center, but you have Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Dubai even Abu Dhabi emerging in financial services. How do you redefine it to sustain a lead?"
"Bahrain's strengths have been and will continue to be its human capital, the people that have led the financial sector and the long standing regulations that have been established in Bahrain. We feel that the distraction caused by the Iranian nuclear issue is holding investment back in the region as a whole, and increasing the security threat. Nobody is debating the right to peaceful nuclear power, but we all have that need and we all need a peaceful resolution to this."
"Gulf Cooperation Council has resolved its historical issue with Iran, but is now looking forward to the future. ""This is such a important issue affecting security worldwide, that we feel it is important and at a level high enough that we need all powers involved,"" says Bahrain's foreign minister. ""We are well beyond that, but going forward..."
"Sheikh Mohammed bin Isa Al Khalifa is chief executive of the Economic Development Board. The board is responsible for stimulating and supporting growth of the Bahraini economy. He was appointed in June 2005, following 10 years working directly for His Highness Sheikh Salman bin Hamad al Khalifa, Crown Prince of Bahrain."
"From 1995 to 1999, he was director of the Crown Princes office. Sheikh Mohammed is married with two sons and one daughter. A keen motor sports enthusiast, he is a former vice president of the Bahrain Motor Club. He was born on April 14, 1969, in Manama, Bahrain."
"In 1992, he received a bachelors degree in economic theory from the American University, Washington DC. Two years later, he got a postgraduate diploma in business studies from the London School of Economics. He is a graduate of the Bahrain Economic Development Board and the University of Bahrain."
"Two suspected car bombs struck Algiers within 10 minutes of each other. Official government count is at least 26, but hospital sources say 76 people were killed. Interior minister blames a militant Islamic group with ties to al Qaeda for the attacks. In a posting on an Islamist Web site, the group al Qaeda Islamic Maghreb claimed responsibility."
"The Web site is known to carry messages, claims and videos from al Qaeda and other militant groups. It said two trucks were filled with no less than 800 kg 1,763 pounds of explosives. At least 10 U.N. staffers were among those killed, according to a U.S. spokeswoman. The group called the operation another successful conquest and a second epic."
The offices of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees were leveled by a blast that struck about 930 a.m. U.N. SecretaryGeneral Ban Kimoon condemned what he called an abjectly cowardly strike against civilian officials serving humanitys highest ideals. Rescuers are working into the night trying to get to the trapped U.S. workers.
"Most of those killed in the coordinated attacks were victims of the first suspected car bombing. That blast struck a bus outside the targeted building, killing many of those on board. One man said he heard the first blast then the second exploded in front of him. He said he has sent senior advisers and other top U.N. officials to head to Algiers."
"I saw the trees falling and the glass shattering in front of me. I had to run away from the car, he said. Zerhouni said the attack was the work of the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat GSPC. That group also uses the name al Qaeda Islamic Maghreb after merging with al Qaeda."
"Algerian guerrillas and al Qaeda in North Africa have merged. The goal is to destabilize countries like Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. The Constitutional Council and Supreme Court were on a list of GSPC targets. Algeria is still recovering from more than a decade of violence that began after the military government called a halt to elections which an Islamist party was poised to win. Tens of thousands of people died in the unrest."
"Lionel Messi scored for the sixth game in a row as Barcelona defeated bigspending Atletico Madrid 30. Barcelona had thumped Atletico 60 on their own ground last season and the visitors were out for revenge. After 15 minutes, Italian goalkeeper Christian Abbiati let a routine Messi cross slip out of his hands and Deco rolled home into the empty net."
Barcelona beat Atletico 2-0 at the Nou Camp. Lionel Messi and Xavi scored the goals for the La Liga champions. Real Madrid beat Recreativo Huleva 20-0 to stay top of the table. Barca still trail Real Madrid by two points in the league after their win. Atletico coach Javier Aguirre admits his side conceded two goals in four minutes.
"Dutch international Ruud van Nistelrooy scored on 72 minutes before Gonzalo Higuain netted in the final minute to keep Real at the summit. Real have made their best start since 1991 but coach Bernd Schusters rotation policy has been questioned with the German chopping and changing his team. Arjen Robben: ""We are now top for the next two weeks and can build on that when we return"""
Levante coach Abel Resino becomes the first Spanish league coach to be sacked this season. Sevilla have just six points from their first six matches and are 13 points behind Real Madrid. Villarreal lost for only the second time in 15 matches with a 32 reverse against Osasuna. Deportivo La Coruna beat Sevilla 10-0.
The Valenciabased club are bottom of the table with only a point from seven matches. Next week they have something completely new to contend with. Fuji Speedway has yet to see a single F1 team put in a single lap. The new circuit is expected to be completed by the end of the year or early 2015.
" Fuji Speedway was the setting for the 1982 arcade game Pole Position released by Namco in Japan and Atari in the rest of the world. The most notable aspect of the circuit is the vision of Mount Fuji, Japans tallest mountain, looming in the distance. The move to this picturesque location is not without its controversies."
"The Japanese Grand Prix will be held at Fuji this year and the next. Suzuka will return to the calendar for 2009 on the condition that the circuit makes some approved modifications. Behind the scenes is a political battleground  both circuits are owned by car manufacturers with F1 connections. Honda owns Suzuka, Toyota owns Fuji. The redesign of the Fuji track was carried out by Hermann Tilke in 2003. Toyota is a relative newcomer to F1 but, having this year surpassed General Motors as the worlds number one automobile manufacturer."
"Tilke, a German architect redesigned a number of F1 circuits in the 1990s. He has since designed many new grand prix tracks including Malaysia, Istanbul, Bahrain and Shanghai. Computeraided design CAD is as much a part of the design of a circuit these days as it is of the hightech cars. Every bend, every straight and every camber is fastidiously analyzed on screen before an ounce of dirt is shifted."
"BMW Saubers simulation experts received CAD data from the Japanese race organizers late last year. The circuit was analyzed and broken up into between 500 and 800 segments. The radius of each individual segment was measured, allowing the engineers to exactly calculate the optimum racing line."
"The slightest change in angle of a gradient can have significant effects on the downforce and aerodynamic profile of a car. We need to have as accurate as possible a picture of downforce levels, gearbox ratios and brake specification in advance, says Willy Rampf, Technical Director of the BMW Sauber F1 Team."
"Once you know that, you look into which gear ratios suit the track with the given level of downforce. Getting a bit closer to the weekend, you start running race simulations in order to predict the optimum race strategy. This prediction takes into account estimates of relevant characteristics of the new track, like the degradation of the two Bridgestone tire compounds. If you have more fuel in the car, this affects your lap time, but we can accurately predict how much time is lost with every extra kilogram of fuel carried."
"The teams have to find a balance between getting the most speed into the straight, and the best grip decelerating into the bends. Our aim is to ensure that the lap times and top speed calculated using the simulation software do not vary by more than one percent from the actual values, says Rampf. Not that everything can be predicted I think we are quite accurate but the ultimate response to that is very difficult to say for sure because it very much depends on what happens in the race."
"Celtic have been fined 50,800 by UEFA and AC Milans Dida has been banned for two matches. The incident occurred when the Scottish side beat Milan 21 in Glasgow. A fan ran onto the field in the 90th minute, soon after the home side scored their winning goal, and made what appeared to be minimal contact with Dida."
"Celtic were found guilty of lack of organisation and improper conduct of supporters. Dida was found to have breached UEFAs principles of loyalty, integrity and sportsmanship. Celtic may choose not to complain about their own punishment, with half of their fine suspended for two years. UEFA did have the power to change the result of the match."
"Milan have pledged to appeal against the punishment, which as it stands means he will miss the clubs Champions League games against Shakhtar Donetsk. Celtic acted swiftly to punish the 27yearold supporter, who turned himself in and has since admitted a breach of the peace in court and will be sentenced next month."
"The club banned the fan for life from all their matches, home and away. Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell said As a club we feel this penalty is proportionate to the incident in question and a fair outcome. White House is blasting Congressional Democrats for not sending a bill that would fund veterans care programs to the presidents desk by Veterans Day."
"Democrats added 3.7 billion to what the president budgeted for veterans programs. The president has threatened to veto the bill because of the added spending. The House passed a healthlaboreducation bill 269142 last week with the veterans funding attached, but the Senate later voted to strip out the funding."
"Perino accused the Democrats of trying to hold hostage our veterans to extra domestic spending or increases in taxes. The president wants clean legislation, a clean bill to fund the veterans, Perino said. On Saturday, the Democratic congressional leadership sent a letter to President Bush saying they welcomed a dialogue on spending. The leadership said last years Congress, which was still under Republican control, had never passed a separate bill funding veterans programs."
"Congress also sent to the president legislation that would fund veterans care at the levels requested by the president through December 14. The current funding level is still below the 3.9 billion extra that we passed, said Nadeam Elshami, spokesman Pelosi. We are committed to getting the extra funding that the Congress already voted on the presidents desk for his signature."
"The Democrats decided not to send the president this bill, Perino said. That has to be laid at their feet. Muddy but unhurt, three University of Texas students emerged from a cramped cave complex in Austin, Texas, after a daylong search."
"Two women and one man were reported missing early Sunday after a trip into Airmans Cave. They were found about halfway down the 12,000footlong cave. The cave has few spaces big enough for an adult to stand upright and is explored primarily by experienced spelunkers."
A friend called 911 to report them missing at 5 a.m. Sunday. The group had told friends to call 911 if they were not back by midnight Sunday. Authorities did not know Sunday evening why the students were in the cave for so long.
"There are so many ways to go, he said. Gen. Than Shwe and his deputies are a friendless regime, Bush said. They should step aside to make way for a unified Burma Myanmar governed by legitimate leaders, she said. The former U.S. first lady made a rare foray into foreign policy."
"The rest of the armed forces should not fear this transition  there is room for a professional military in a democratic Burma, Bush said. Bush called on Myanmars military leaders to release Aun Sung Suu Kyi and other opposition leaders so they can meet with and plan for a transition to democracy. Meanwhile, the world watches  and waits, Bush warns."
"Myanmar state media has reported that 2,000 people were detained during the demonstrations and the crackdown against them. The official death toll from Myanmars leadership is at 10, but there are reports that hundreds were killed and thousands arrested in the wake of the demonstrations that peaked late September. The time for a free Burma is now."
"U.N. SecretaryGeneral Ban Kimoon called Laura Bush to update her on the efforts of his special envoy to Myanmar, Ibrahim Gambari. Gambari met last week with the military junta leadership as well as with Nobel Peace Prize winner Suu Kyi, who is under house arrest in Yangon. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Zalmay Khalilzad, told reporters that Laura Bush and her husbands administration believe that there is a need to start preparing for transition."
"Bush accuses Democratic leaders of wasting money and plotting tax increases. Congress should cut spending and send me a responsible measure, he says. The bill would have funded the departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services. It also would have funding projects such as a prison museum, a sailing school and a program to teach Portuguese.  President Bush said the bill was laden with 10 billion in pork."
"The bill includes about 150 billion to run those departments. The bill also includes more than 450 billion in mandatory spending on Medicare and Medicaid. While polls show Bushs popularity remains at nearrecord lows, Congress ranks even lower as a whole. The president has taken numerous opportunities to mock the spending habits of the Democratic leadership and force confrontations over the appropriations bills."
"The committees chairman, Rep. David Obey, called Bushs veto not responsible and not credible. This is a bipartisan bill supported by over 50 Republicans, Obey said in a statement issued after the veto. It is clear the only reason the president vetoed this bill is pure politics, he said."
"Tuesday's veto is the fifth cast since Democrats took control of Congress in 2006. Congress has overridden one of those, voting last week to authorize 23 billion in water projects nationwide over the presidents objections. Democrats will schedule another override vote this week, an aide to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said."
Bush signed a 470 billion Pentagon spending bill that covers the Defense Departments normal operations. Democrats split 50 billion in spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan off into a bridge fund to which they plan to attach demands for Bush to withdraw U.S. combat troops. The measure sets up another confrontation with the White House. Bush also demanded Congress reform the alternative minimum tax.
"Congress should eliminate the tax increases in the bill and send the AMT relief to my desk as soon as possible. The elimination of the tax would cause an estimated 800 billion to be lost over 10 years. To replace that, Rangels bill would add a 4 percent surtax on individual incomes over 100,000."
"Bush: Raising taxes is one of the most unwise things Congress could possibly do. Bush acknowledged the difficulties Americans face from high fuel prices, a challenged housing market and uncertainty in financial markets stemming from the collapse of the subprime mortgage market. France lock Sebastien Chabal cited for a dangerous tackle on Englands Simon Shaw during Saturdays World Cup semifinal in Paris."
"The Sale Sharks forward will face a disciplinary hearing on Monday after his tackle on opposite secondrower Shaw was noted by citing commissioner Dennis Wheelahan. Chabal started the match on the substitutes bench, but was brought on in the 26th minute to replace the injured Fabien Pelous. If he is suspended, then Chabal will miss Fridays third and fourthplace playoff match at the Parc des Princes."
England seeking to become the first nation to defend the World Cup title. Jonny Wilkinson again had problems with the match balls during the semifinal. The flyhalf voiced his concerns after struggling with the boot against Australia. He rejected a ball before kicking a vital threepointer against France. France won the match 50-50.
"We didnt say it last week but a nonmatch ball got onto the field in Marseille which Jonny kicked, director of rugby Rob Andrew said. He didnt think about it while he was kicking it. The match balls are marked, numbered one to six. Last night they hadWorld Cup semifinal England vs France written on them."
"Colorado man terrorized by threats after testifying against his daughters abusive boyfriend. Keith Reynolds was convicted for witness intimidation after threatening witnesses in his domestic assault case. Man has spent 10,000 on a security system, hired a bodyguard for his sons wedding and never leaves home without a.45caliber handgun strapped to his chest. The state did nothing to protect him after the 1999 conviction of Keith Reynolds for domestic abuse."
"A report in the Denver Post pointed out major problems protecting witnesses in the state of Colorado. Paul Logli, chairman of National District Attorneys Association, told Congress this year that witness intimidation has become almost epidemic. When asked if prosecutors had made the family aware of Colorados witness protection program, the witness in the Reynolds case said, All they told us was maybe we should move."
"After Reynolds conviction, the witness and his wife saw strange cars parked outside their home. They received phone calls during which the only sound on the other end of the line was a gun being cocked. The couple received a death threat from Reynolds himself through the mail."
"Reynolds was then sentenced to ten years in a maximum security prison for witness intimidation. No national statistics on crimes against witnesses exist, and minimal research has been conducted on the subject. Colorado has 50,000 allocated to its witness protection budget."
"The city of Denver spent almost 100,000 on landscaping last year. The state, on average, spends about 1,000 per witness. The federal program spends in excess of 40 million per year on witness protection."
"The Rev. Leon Kelly says Colorado's witness protection program is a joke. Kelly says the state does not provide enough incentive for witnesses to come forward. Colorado Department of Public Safety: Witness protection is a way to ensure the immediate safety of the witnesses, not a long-term relocation at the publics expense."
Rhonda Fields says failures in the witness protection program may have contributed to her sons murder. Javad Fields was a college graduate who was engaged to be married. He was shot twice in the head by men he considered friends.
Javad Fields witnessed the murder of his best friend and subsequently testified against three men suspected in the killing. Rhonda Fields says her son was never told about a witness protection program.
Javads mother does not think it was her sons responsibility to ask for protection. I think its the authorities responsibility to notify witnesses of the dangers that are involved with being a witness.
"Fields case illustrates glaring weaknesses in the witness protection program. Prosecutors filed an order for protection requesting Javad Fields personal information be kept secret. It wasnt signed by a judge until one year later, after defense lawyers had already given the suspects Fields' personal information. District Attorney Carol Chambers maintains the program has improved."
"Previously unseen footage of Diana has been shown to the jury at the inquest into her death. Images taken from a security camera at the Ritz Hotel in Paris show the 36yearold smiling as she and her lover Dodi Fayed step into an elevator. Further footage shows Fayed visiting a jewelers shop, images that could lend support to claims that he was buying an engagement ring."
Lord Justice Scott Baker told the jury at the inquest into the deaths of the princess and her lover Dodi Fayed that scientific evidence might be unable to demonstrate one way or the other whether she was in the early stages of pregnancy. But he said they would hear intimate details of her personal life. Baker said Diana may have been on the contraceptive pill and evidence she was poised to get engaged to Dodi on the night she died was contradictory.
"The jury is set to hear scene setting evidence, including CCTV and a tourist video. The inquest to establish cause of death is expected to be a sixmonth process. Fayeds father, Mohammed Al Fayed, has contended that Diana and his son were murdered because the royal family could not accept that an Egyptian Muslim could eventually be stepfather to the future king of England."
"Baker told the jury of Al Fayeds allegations, but again reminded them that they were responsible for deciding the facts of the case. You have to decide four important, but limited factual questions. The first three questions are unlikely to give rise to any difficulty. The fourth is a rather wider question and is directed towards the means by which they died."
"Diana, 36, and Dodi Fayed were killed on August 31, 1997 when the MercedesBenz they were traveling in hit a pillar in the Pont de lAlma tunnel in Paris. They were being pursued at the time by the paparazzi after leaving the Ritz Hotel. Driver Henri Paul, who was also killed, was drunk and driving at high speed."
"Web site for the inquest has posted previously unpublished pictures taken by paparazzi of the limo before and immediately after the accident. One is a closeup  looking into the front of the vehicle that shows Diana, Fayed, Paul and ReesJones minutes before the crash. Republicans react with surprise and recrimination Sunday to blistering criticism of the Iraq war from retired Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez."
"Sanchez was coalition commander in 2003 and 2004. He said the Bush administration, the State Department and Congress all share blame. Sanchez also said such dereliction of duty by a military officer would mean immediate dismissal or court martial. South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said he and GOP presidential candidate Sen. John McCain had visited Sanchez several times."
"Sanchez's own record in Iraq is blemished. Abu Ghraib got out of control under his watch. But Graham said that finally, with the commitment of nearly 30,000 additional U.S. troops since January, We are getting it right."
"Sanchez said it had been his duty to obey orders and not object publicly while on active duty. He said he has an obligation to speak out now that he has retired. While the politicians espouse a rhetoric designed to preserve their reputations and their political power, our soldiers die, he said."
"One of the reasons few speak out is evidenced by what happened to former Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric Shinseki, McCain said. Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, told ABCs This Week that Sanchez is simply wrong. My definition of winning is a stable country and an ally in the war on terror, he said."
"Zbigniew Brzezinski says the central government in Iraq has been an embarrassment. Graham says he hopes the government of Nuri alMaliki will step up to the plate and do something meaningful by the end of the year. If that does not happen, he said, it will be incumbent upon us, as a nation, to devise a new political strategy."
"Even those Iraqis who were happy to see Saddam Hussein toppled from power more than four years ago are not happy with the continuing U.S. presence, Brzezinski says. No one in the world really supports our policy in Iraq, he says. In his Friday speech, Sanchez added that the surge of U.s. troops into Iraq represents a desperate attempt by the administration."
"National Security Council spokeswoman Kate Starr did not address the comment. As Gen. Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker said, theres more work to be done but progress is being made in Iraq. And thats what were focused on now."
"GOP presidential candidates face off for first time in over a month. Candidates try to differentiate their views on immigration, Iraq war, abortion, gun control. Unlike previous debates, candidates launch attacks on each other instead of Hillary Clinton. Ryan Crocker, U.S. ambassador to Iraq, is the moderator of the CNNYouTube GOP debate."
"Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney traded jabs over illegal immigration. Romney attacked Giulianis record, saying that as mayor, he promoted illegalimmigration. Giuliani shot back, accusing Romney of having a sanctuary mansion at his own home."
"In his quest to appeal to the hardline immigration wing of the party, Romney also turned some of his fire on the same topic toward former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Romney denied Giulianis allegation, and the two raised their voices as they tried to talk over each other."
"Rep. Tom Tancredo, who has anchored his candidacy on securing the borders and cracking down on illegal immigration, seemed delighted with the give and take. Sen. John McCain, freshly back from a visit to Iraq over Thanksgiving and the most hawkish of the candidates, and Rep. Ron Paul, the most antiwar of the candidate, tangled on two occasions over the Iraq war."
Paul said bringing the troops home from Iraq would save a trillion dollars. McCain said its that kind of isolationism that caused World War II. Paul replied The real question you have to ask is why do I get the most money from active duty officers and military personnel?
"Keith Kerr, a retired brigadier general, asked candidates if they thought U.S. military personnel were professional enough to work with gay and lesbian troops. CNN later learned that a June media release from the campaign of Democratic frontrunner Clinton listed Kerr as a member of its steering committee."
"Kerr told CNN after the debate that he has not worked for the Clinton campaign and was representing no one other than himself. Kerr also said he is a member of the Log Cabin Republicans, a national gay and lesbian Republican grassroots organization. CNN had verified Kerrs military background and that he had not contributed money to any presidential candidate."
"A viewer, holding the Bible, asked Do you believe every word of this book? Huckabee, a Baptist minister, said, Sure, I believe the Bible is exactly what it is. Giuliani said he believes the Bible but not literally true in every respect."
Romney stammered a bit when moderator Anderson Cooper asked him if he believed every word. Romney said he was wrong in favoring a womans right to choose  his position when he was elected governor of Massachusetts. Watch the candidates get personal about the Bible.
"Paul: ""On abortion, I was wrong"" His remarks came in response to a 30second video produced for the debate by Thompsons campaign. The video included a clip of Romney expressing support for Roe vs. Wade during a 1994 debate against Sen. Ted Kennedy. When asked what women and doctors should be charged with if abortion was to become illegal, Paul said it was not an issue for the president."
"He added that the issue should be left to the states and courts and not federal authorities. On the issues of taxes, Thompson said hed never met a tax he liked. Ive got a taxcut bill on the table. But I dont do pledges to anybody but the American people"
Rep. Duncan Hunter said China is cheating on trade... and its in the interest of the United States to stop Chinas cheating. The candidates fielded video questions submitted by the public via the YouTube Web site. The debate was the first time the GOP candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month.
"None of the 1,000plus Iraqi detainees freed in recent weeks have broken a pledge not to return to the insurgency. Maj. Gen. Doug Stone described the detention system as open and transparent. He said it makes the detainees better citizens and helps break the cycle of violence and poverty in the country. CNNs political team viewed nearly 5,000 videos for the GOP debate. About 2,000 more than they saw for the Democrats debate."
"U.S. detention centers are political sore points for Sunnis, who make up 83 percent of the detainees. The main Sunni political coalition cited the centers as one reason for quitting the government during the summer. Stone said detainees get free medical care equal to what he gets as a general, food and water made to Islamic standards, educational opportunities, jobs skills and contact with families. Last month, the U.Sled coalition launched Operation Lions Paw in which between 50 and 70 detainees would be released daily."
"I am pleased to tell you that in the more 1,000 that have gone through this program and taken the pledge, not one has returned to threaten Iraqi or coalition forces. Stone said the releases would continue at the same pace beyond Ramadan. There are no secrets that go on in detention, Stone said."
"Each detainee has a chance to take classes up to a sixthgrade level, and high school classes are being planned. By the time of their release, detainees grow in terms of working in an intersectarian environment, Stone says."
"The average stay for a detainee is 300 days, but some have been detained for two years or longer. A review board interviews detainees to decide if they are a threat to security. If they are deemed not to be, they are offered freedom in exchange for taking the pledge."
"Only 280 detainees are foreigners, mostly from Syria, Egypt, Iran, Sudan and Saudi Arabia. Charles and Diane Winkler had asked the court to intervene and either revoke Mary Winklers visitation rights or allow them to proceed only under supervision of a counselor. Mary Winkler was convicted of killing her minister husband Matthew Winkler."
"The children  Patricia, Mary Alice and Brianna have been living with their grandparents since their mother was arrested last year. Winkler has not seen the children in 15 months, her attorney said. A jury convicted Winkler earlier this year of voluntary manslaughter in the shotgun death of Matthew Winkler."
"Winkler received a threeyear sentence, but a judge required her to serve only 210 days. Charles and Diane Winkler have filed a 2 million wrongful death suit against her for their sons slaying. At the time of their fathers death in March 2006, Patricia was 8, Mary Alice was 6 and Brianna was 1."
"The termination issue has not been decided in court. The court may want to determine what, if any, bond Winkler has with her children before making a decision. In September, a lower court granted Winkler visitation with her daughters pending the outcome of the custody battle."
"A subsequent appeal by the grandparents was denied, leading to their Supreme Court appeal. The Winklers said if their former daughterinlaw got visitation with the children at all, it should be under the supervision of a professional counselor. They said the children exhibit fear and confusion toward their mother and her role in their fathers death."
"The Winklers say the children have experienced urination accidents, sleeping problems, graphic nightmares and sleepwalking. They say the lower court erred by failing to appoint the guardian ad litem until after the September hearing. Turner, however, said she believes terminating Winklers parental rights would not be in the childrens best interest."
"Winkler fled with the girls to the Alabama coast, where she was arrested. She said during a September appearance on the Oprah Winfrey Show that she never expected to get away with killing her husband. Pakistans president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, has been under pressure to lift a state of emergency."
"GEOTV and ARY Digital offer a variety of programming, including news, entertainment, sports and music. Both networks had been banned from Pakistans cable television system. This latest action prevents the two Pakistani networks from broadcasting worldwide via satellite."
"The action was not wholly unexpected, but surprising nevertheless, Aslan said. Dubai is a media city which seemed to be a haven and a sanctuary, he said. ""We were ready for it to a certain extent"""
"The government has made numerous demands of the network, although none of them official, Aslan said. Musharrafs emergency order put several restrictions on the media, preventing journalists from expressing opinions prejudicial to the ideology... or integrity of Pakistan."
"Journalists are also restricted from covering suicide bombings and militant activity. Musharraf has denied that his restrictions bar criticism, saying they only ask for responsibility in reporting. Last week, Pakistan expelled three print journalists for using language in an editorial."
Some smaller television channels have complied with the governments restrictions. GEO and ARY have refused. Most of the other channels have kowtowed in order to survive. Musharraf has said the emergency order improves stability and will foster peaceful parliamentary elections.
"Opposition leaders accuse Musharraf of declaring emergency rule to keep his hold on power. Blast sends thick plume of smoke over a section of Jacksonville, Florida. Fire Department spokesman: ""There is no other way to describe it. Literally, its a hellish inferno"""
"Fourteen people were hospitalized after the blast at the T2 Lab on Faye Road, in an industrial area on the waterfront in north Jacksonville. Six of those injured were transported to Shands Hospital in Jacksonville, hospital spokeswoman Kelly Brockmeier says. Officials initially ordered an evacuation of nearby businesses, but by 4 p.m. the order had been lifted."
"A Shands official said the hospital incident command system had been activated. The billowing black smoke could be seen from the citys downtown. A woman who answered the T2 Labs 24hour facility emergency phone said the plant manufactures ecotane, a gasoline additive that reduces tailpipe emissions."
"They described a hissing noise and then a sound wave, she said. Antonio Padrigan was trying to get in touch with his son, who works in a plant. He was shook up when he called me, but I cant get through to him anymore, Padrigan said."
"Carlton Higginbotham, 63, was working at home on Townsend Boulevard in Jacksonville when a loud boom shook his house. It was a gunshottype explosion it wasnt a rumble, he said. The cloud that came out of it was white, some would say mushroomshaped, Higgin botham said."
"Nasser al Ansari is the CEO of Qatari Diar, a stateowned real estate investment company. The company is famous for its purchase of Londons Chelsea Barracks. Al Ansari was responsible for high profile projects such as New Doha International Airport and the promotion of private sector investment through public sector privatization."
"Nasser al Ansari is the CEO of Qatari Diar. Al Ansari was at the office of the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs as technical advisor. He joins us on MME to talk about the vision for Qatar, how Qatari diar fits into it and its investments outside Gulf in Morocco, Sudan, Syria, Egypt and Europe."
But now we are fortunate with a high level of education and the reformations in government policies in this region. We now understand how to utilize this wealth and economical growth. I dont think most people know that you sit on one of the largest natural gas fields in the world. This must give you great cushion to expand the Qatari Diar model.
"We are investing a lot in real estate, not just in Qatar but worldwide. Its almost foreign policy strategy to invest in the poorer countries in the region. I think with the knowledge and knowhow that we have gained in this area of expertise, we would like to export it to other countries."
"JD Its quite a radical departure say from the International Monetary Fund or World Bank giving loans or grants for development. This is turning the world upside down in your region, it is not? NA Yes, I would like to assure you at Qatari Diar we are not in the business of lending."
I mean we want to make sure that the investment we are making is there for the longterm. Qatari Diar has a policy its a longterm policy not shortterm. We would like to showcase the strength of the people of Qatar. We want to pull the flag of the state of Qatar even across the Atlantic and we are determined to do so.
"Death Penalty Information Center DPIC: 42 people have been put to death this year. That figure is down 57 percent from what it was in 1999, when 98 inmates were executed. Supreme Court will hold oral arguments January 7 about the constitutionality of lethal injection protocols."
"The Supreme Court is to hold oral arguments January 7 about whether lethal injection protocols in 36 of the 37 states with the death penalty are constitutional. The justices placed a moratorium on executions in late September, when they decided to review a Kentucky case. Stays of executions have been issued in several states until the larger constitutional issues are addressed."
"If the high court finds the procedures unconstitutional, it could take years before deathpenalty states would meet legal standards necessary to resume lethal injection. Even if the method is declared acceptable, it would be months before new execution dates could be set."
"Texas continues to lead the nation, with 62 percent of executions nationwide this year. Overall, 86 percent this year were in the South. The death penalty has been in a period of decline for many years."
"Death penalty supporters acknowledge that states outside the South have been reluctant to impose the punishment. I think the main problem is that the death penalty is not being imposed often enough in those urban jurisdictions, said Kent Scheidegger of the Sacramentobased Criminal Justice Legal Foundation. New Jerseys legislature voted last week to outlaw death penalty  the first state to do so in 42 years."
"Jon Corzine signed the measure into law Monday. At the same time, he commuted the sentences of the eight men on the states death row. Similar bills in Nebraska, New Mexico and Montana failed this year."
"The Supreme Court on January 4 will decide whether to review an appeal from Louisiana inmate Patrick Kennedy. Kennedy was sentenced to death in 2003 for raping his 8yearold stepdaughter. The justices in 1976 banned capital punishment for rape, but 19 years later, Louisiana passed a law allowing execution for the sexual violation of a child under 12."
"Zenit finish top of the table with 61 points, two points ahead of secondplaced Spartak Moscow. Zenit went ahead in the 15th minute when Radek Sirls shot from the edge of the box deflected off a Ramenskoye defender and beat goalkeeper Antonin Kinski. After the interval, the hosts poured forward seeking an equalizer and created several chances but Zenit held firm."
Roman Pavyuchenko and Soares Welliton scored for Spartak. Radoslav Kovac scored an own goal for Dynamo Moscow. Rostov and Krasnodar were relegated from the Premier League. Click here for all the latest from the Russian Premier League this season.
Celtic held 11-0 by managerless Hibernian in Scottish Premier League. Gordon Strachans team head the table by three points from Glasgow rivals Rangers. Rangers have three games in hand ahead of Sunday's trip to Aberdeen. David Murphy scored the only goal of the game in the 20th minute at Celtic Park. The Englishman's shot from the edge of the box went in off the crossbar.
"Jiri Jarosik rescues Celtic from first home SPL defeat this season. Hibernian held on despite having to play the final few minutes with 10 men. The victory lifted the visitors up into fifth place, while Celtic have taken just six points from the last five games.Murphys only other goal this season came in Hibs 10 win at Rangers on October 6. He has scored just once in the SPL so far this season, in a 1-1 draw with St Johnstone."
"Strachan is hoping to sign Brazilian defender Coelho next month. The Scotland boss is unhappy with the number of chances his side have missed. Strachan said: ""We could have definitely done something with every one of them. Its not been great to look at, and we need to cut it out"""
"Thirdplaced Motherwell missed the chance to move above Rangers. Falkirk climbed to ninth with two goals in the second half to Michael Higdon and then another from Patrick Clegg on 65 minutes. Fourthplaced Dundee United failed to take advantage, losing 21 at home to bottom club Gretna whose only two wins this season have come against the Tangerines."

Gretna are seven points ahead of second bottom side St Mirran after a 1-1 draw with St Johnstone. The game was a repeat of last weekend's shock 32-1 victory against Celtic.
"Churchgoers in six states have held prayer sessions along the side of Interstate 35. The highway runs through six U.S. states, from southern Texas to northern Minnesota. CNN traveled to Texas, the southernmost state in the I35 corridor, to do a story about a prayer campaign called Light the Highway. The campaign is called ""Light the Highway"""
"Churchgoers in all six states recently finished 35 days of praying alongside Interstate 35. Some of the faithful believe that in order to fulfill the prophecy of I35 being the holy highway, it needs some intensive prayer first. They prayed that adult businesses along the corridor would see the light and perhaps close down."
Cindy Jacobs says she received a revelation to start this campaign. She says she cant be sure Interstate 35 really is what is mentioned in the Bible. They prayed for safety and freedom from crime for people who lived along the interstate.
"Jacobs also points out that perhaps there is a link between the area near this highway and tragedies that have happened in history. Thats why prayer certainly cant hurt, she adds. At an adult gogo club, the owner tells us he resents people trying to impose their will on others. And he says his club holds fundraisers, food drives and toy drives to help the community."
"Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is on a campaign to make Venezuelans cut back on drinking and smoking. But on the side of the road, the prayerful arent going to change their minds. Holy highways and nude clubs, they believe, are not a combination God has in mind."
"Taxes on whiskey, brandy, cognac and other drinks that dont come from cane sugar have been raised 1.79 3,838 bolivares per liter. Its unfair because, in the end, the consumer is the one who pays, says Fernando Fernandez, a liquor exporter. They say theyre going to stop eating so that they can continue drinking, says one woman who lives in Venezuela."
"Chavez has described whiskey as a drink for rich people, not for revolutionaries. The moves represent the first steps toward transforming each Venezuelan into what Chavez calls the new man. Chavez has cited the life of revolutionary socialist icon Ernesto Che Guevara as an example of how to lead a more pure life."
"Also effective Monday, stores near schools, churches and cultural centers will not be granted licenses to sell alcohol. Taxes on cigarette imports have also increased, from 50 percent to 70 percent of the total price. Some people said they dont understand the motivations for the increase, but predicted their consumption would not change."
"The Venezuelan is not going to stop drinking or smoking, said one person. Chavez also plans to increase taxes on luxury items such as Hummers. There is no Hummer dealership in the country."
"Obesity is the No. 1 health crisis in the U.S., former President Clinton says. Former President Clinton spoke at CNNs first Fit Nation Summit. Chavez said he wants to focus less on material goals for Venezuelas 27 million people, 38 percent of whom live in poverty."
"Twothirds of adult Americans are overweight or obese the same is true for onethird of U.S. children. Obesity carries increased risk of myriad health problems, including hypertension, diabetes, heart disease and arthritis. Clinton and CNNs chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, gathered with experts from across the country Wednesday to explore solutions to Americas obesity crisis. They addressed such proposed solutions as healthy school lunches, elimination of trans fats, the need for healthier food in urban communities."
"Clinton: Motivating Americans, especially kids, wont be easy. Kids need to know its important, but fitness cant be boring, he said. Clinton has been tackling the obesity issue over the past few years with his Alliance for a Healthier Generation."
"Trans fats have been shown to raise LDL or bad cholesterol in people and lower their HDL, or good cholesterol. Michael Jacobson, director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, is a strong advocate against trans fats in foods. He says the Food and Drug Administration should ban trans fats altogether."
"The panel took questions from an audience of 150 people  mostly obesity experts or those who work in industries that deal with obesity. Gupta was inspired to launch Fit Nation, an ongoing, multiplatform, grassroots initiative against obesity. Over the past three years, Gupta and the CNN Medical Unit have crisscrossed the country."
"This year, Gupta traveled from Michigan to California asking the public to pledge to add 1 million hours to their collective lives. Since he began the tour in April, the campaign has surpassed its goal. Gupta said he hopes that legislators and administrators who can make a difference in policy and perhaps change attitudes about obesity will hear the solutions discussed at the summit."
Yuvraj Singh smashed six sixes in one over as England crashed out of crickets World Twenty20 tournament in South Africa. Paul Collingwoods side were eliminated at the Super Eights stage after South Africa earlier beat New Zealand by six wickets in Durban.
"Singh reached the fastest 50 in Twenty20 history, needing just 12 deliveries. The lefthanders six consecutive sixes in the 19th over bowled by Stuart Broad. England then lost by 18 runs to the Singhinspired Indians, who kept their semifinal hopes alive ahead of Thursdays mustwin clash with the hosts. Singh is the first player to do so in Twenty 20 matches and just the fourth in all senior cricket."
"Virender Sehwag topscored with 68 off 52 balls, putting on 136 for the first wicket with Gautam Gambhir. England battled gamely but could only post 2006 in their 20 overs. Irfan Pathan claimed figures of 337 off four overs, while Rudra Pratap Singh took 228."
"If India can beat South Africa, it would create a threeway tie and require net runrates to decide the two teams going through. The Proteas have two wins from two Group E outings after beating New Zealand. South Africa restricted the Black Caps to 1538 from their 20 overs on Wednesday, then reached the target with five deliveries to spare. Justin Kemp was named man of the match after smashing a six off the otherwise economical Mark Gillespie for the winning runs."
"Kemp added 28 in four overs with Gibbs 19 before putting on another 65 in eight overs with Mark Boucher. Boucher departed for 23, caught by wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum off Gillespie. The experienced Shaun Pollock then joined Kemp, and struck one six in his unbeaten 16 off 11 deliveries to help guide the Proteas to their second victory."
"Morkel ends with figures of 417 off four overs. He had Shane Bond caught by Boucher, and then almost became the first Twenty20 bowler to claim five wickets. His penultimate delivery which clean bowled Gillespie was declared a noball by umpire Billy Doctrove. The man arrested for the videotaped rape of a toddler in Las Vegas will make his initial appearance in court Friday."
"Elaine Thomas says she lived in fear after seeing enhanced photos from the videotape on the local news. Stiles, 37, was taken into custody Monday night after a Henderson, Nevada, police officer pulled over the white Buick Century he was driving. Thomas said she screamed when she recognized the photos on television."
"The judge in the case will hold an administrative hearing Wednesday, but Stiles will not be present. Stiles was already being sought on an unrelated 2004 charge of felony lewdness with a child under 14. Authorities amended that earlier filing on October 4 to include 20 counts related to the videotaped rape. The child on the videotape was younger than 3 when the abuse occurred."
Henderson Police Officer Mike Dye said he pulled over Stiles car Monday night because it did not have a license plate. Dye became suspicious when the driver gave him an expired California drivers license with a photo that did not look like him.
"Stiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, was turned over to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police. He had been sought in connection with the videotape, which shows a girl being sexually assaulted. The tape was given to authorities by Darren Tuck, who told police he had found it in the desert five months before handing it over."
"He turned himself in to authorities in Nye County, Nevada, earlier this month. Professionals have evaluated the girl in the videotape since she was found, and she appears to be healthy and fine and happy. The mother had not known her daughter had ever been victimized and was apparently oblivious to efforts to find her until late last month."
"Donohue said the mother recognized Stiles, a former animal trainer. The alleged abuse most likely occurred while the mother  a single woman working six days a week was at work, he said. Another former girlfriend of Stiles said this month she thinks she is the reason Stiles came in contact with the girl."
"Also living in the apartment were a family friend and her daughter. Todd Allen, Tina Allens son, said he recognized his old apartment from scenes in the video. Eduardo Gonzalez, a petty officer second class with the U.S. Navy, is about to be deployed overseas for a third time."
"Eduardo Gonzalez's wife faces deportation to Guatemala. She has not seen her home country since 1989. Eduardo worries about what would happen to his young son, Eduardo Jr., if she is deported. ""I like being in uniform and serving my country, but if she goes back Im going to have to give it all up,"" he said."
"Gonzalez, who works on helicopters that bring cargo, supplies and military personnel in and out of Iraq, testified before a House Judiciary Committee panel last month. He urged officials to consider some sort of policy to deal with cases like his, where military members families could be deported while theyre defending their country overseas."
"Each is handled casebycase, not by the military, but by immigration authorities. Lt. Col. Margaret Stock, a member of the U.S. Army Reserves, teaches immigration law at West Point. She believes there should be an overall policy dealing with the potential deportation of family members of active duty military members. When youre in a combat zone, you need to be focusing all of your energies on fighting the enemy."
"The government is conflicted about how to treat such cases, Stock says. On the one hand, the government is supposed to be providing military families with assistance, housing and other forms of benefits while their spouses are overseas, she says. But the same government is trying to deport the very same people, she adds."
"In Gonzalezs case, his wife, Mildred, came to the United States with her mother in 1989 when she was 5 years old. They were granted political asylum because of their status as war refugees from Guatemala. Her mother was granted legal status in July 2004, according to Gonzalez. But six weeks earlier, Gonzalez and Mildred got married, canceling Mildreds ability to apply for legal status through her mother."
"A judge in June granted her a oneyear extension to remain in the United States. If her legal status does not change by June 8, 2008, she will have 60 days to voluntarily leave the country or face deportation. Thats just fine, according to Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies."
"Gonzalez: ""Theres no justification for that kind of policy"" Gonzalez himself entered the country legally, crossing the Mexican border with his family when he was about 10. He joined the Navy as a socalled greencard sailor and became a U.S. citizen in July 2005."
"The military does accept some immigrants who arent U.S. citizens. Emmanuel Woko, a member of the Armys 2nd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, understands just how Gonzalez and his family feel. We didnt come here to break the law. We just want to feel safe and have a home just like everybody else."
His wife and children could be sent back to Nigeria. My heart is bleeding on the thought that my wife could be deported. I am extremely distressed and distracted by the thought. Thats a sentiment echoed by Gonzalez. We are just asking for our families to stay with us.
"Heavy rains and flooding have forced hundreds of thousands of people from homes in southern Mexicos state of Tabasco. Officials say about 300,000 people are still trapped by the worst flooding in the region for 50 years. The Grijalva River pushed over its banks through the state capital of Villahermosa on Thursday."
"About 700,000 people have seen their homes flooded, with about 300,000 of those still trapped there. One death had been blamed on the floods, which followed weeks of heavy rain in the largely swampy state. Tabasco borders Guatemala to the south and the Gulf of Mexico to the north."
"The Grijalva River, one of two large waterways ringing Villahermosa, has risen 6.5 feet 2 meters above its critical level. Authorities said some of the rivers were continuing to rise. The flooding was not related to Tropical Storm Noel, which was pounding the Caribbean."
"U.N. calls on NATO to do more to stop the Afghan opium trade. Report shows the export value of this years poppy harvest stood at around 4 billion, a 29 per cent increase over 2006. Afghan villagers tend to opium poppies in Talibancontrolled Helmand province."
"Despite Afghan security forces efforts to curb the trade, 660 tons of heroin and morphine were trafficked out of the country in 2007, the report said. Opium has accounted for more than half of Afghanistans gross domestic product in 2007. About a quarter of the earnings from opium go to farmers, according to the U.N."
"The rest goes to district officials who collect taxes on the crop, to drug traffickers and to insurgents and warlords who control the trade. Since drugs are funding the insurgency, NATO has a selfinterest in supporting Afghan forces in destroying drug labs, markets and convoys. Destroy the drug trade and you cut off the Talibans main funding source, a U.N. official says. A NATO spokesman says coalition forces are equally concerned by the rapid growth in the narcotics trade."
"We share the U.N. concerns, Appathurai told CNN. Drugs not only poison people, but they poison economies and governments, he said. Farming of opium poppies has been almost eradicated in the north and west of the country. NATO forces are providing assistance to Afghan police through training and transport."
"U.N. observers have noticed a proliferation of heroin labs in neighboring countries and along trafficking routes. Costa said the labs are dependent on precursor chemicals, like acetic anhydride, that must be smuggled into the region. He called for tighter controls in chemicalproducing countries and stronger intelligencesharing."
Appathurai said the most effective way to curb the drug trade was tackling the insurgency headon. He also said it was important to provide alternative work for poor Afghan farmers to encourage them to give up opium production. You cannot have eradication in isolation.
"David Nalbandian beat Roger Federer in the final of the Madrid Masters. The Argentine, ranked 25th in the world, repeated his 2005 upset win over the Swiss star in that years seasonending Masters Cup. Defending champion Federer, playing in his first tournament since winning the U.S. Open six weeks ago, made 38 unforced errors."
"Nalbandian won his first title on the ATP Tour since May, 2006. The 25-year-old lost in the Madrid final in 2004. He spent a year without a coach, but has revived his career since teaming up with Hernan Gumy."
"Roger and I have a long history and I think that influenced the match. It was an extremely hard first set. But I tightened the teeth and I began to play more strongly. Things came out fine, I played incredible."
"He came back strong and played well in the end. He was a better player all in all. I was struggling after the first set to play aggressively, for some reason. He played tough and didnt miss"
Juan Roman Riquelme scored twice as Argentina beat Bolivia 30 to notch a third successive victory in the South American qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup. The midfielder followed up his brace of spectacular freekicks in the opening 20 victory against Chile to help put his country five points clear of secondplaced Brazil. Argentina play Peru in Lima on Sunday in their next qualifier.
The 19-year-old scored his first goal at international level five minutes before the interval after starting in a threeman attack with Carlos Tevez and Lionel Messi. Riquelme added the second 11 minutes after the break with a dipping freekick which beat Carlos Arias from 25 yards. And he finished off the scoring in the 73rd minute with a cool sidefoot finish after being set up by Messi.
"Sen. Hillary Clinton says troop withdrawal is too little, too late. Colombia beat Venezuela 10, and Paraguay routed Ecuador 51. Ecuador coach Luis Fernando Suarez, a Colombian, quit after his teams loss saying I have taken the irrevocable decision to resign. In an open letter to Bush, Clinton said the troop withdrawal was unacceptable to this Congress, and to the American people."
"Bush is expected to endorse the recommendations of Gen. David Petraeus that the troop levels in Iraq be lowered to 130,000 by July. Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois says the president is returning to an earlier, failed policy. We now are still in the same position as we essentially were in June 2006, Obama says. ""I strongly urge you to choose this course of action,"" he says."
"Obama presented a new plan for Iraq on Wednesday afternoon in Clinton, Iowa. It calls for an immediate drawdown of combat operations at a pace of one or two brigades every month, to be completed by the end of next year. A brigade comprises between 3,000 and 5,000 soldiers."
"Presidential candidate John Edwards calls for an immediate withdrawal of 40,000 to 50,000 troops. Edwards says Democrats have a moral responsibility to use every tool available to them, including a filibuster. Obama recommends a new constitutional convention for Iraq, a new regional diplomatic effort and steps to confront the countrys humanitarian crisis. ""There is no military solution in Iraq, and there never was,"" Obama says in his speech."
"Edwards also called Obamas plan for troop withdrawal a copy of the presidents plan. Obama would withdraw only one to two combat brigades a month between now and the end of next year, said Edwards, which for the next several months could essentially mimic the presidents own plans to withdraw 30,000 troops by next summer. Democrats lack the votes in Congress to force the president to bring the troops home and are seeking a compromise position."
"Democratic leaders are meeting with Republican lawmakers, who want a change in war policy. Privately, Democrats concede that the next president probably will inherit at least a deployment of 100,000 troops in Iraq. Obama said it was unlikely he would vote for any legislation that does not include a definite withdrawal deadline. ""It appears clear to me that the president is not willing to compromise,"" Obama told CNN."
"Atlantas High Museum of Art opens second year of Louvrefueled shows from Paris. The High is also opening an exhibition about influences on the Impressionists. ""What we need is a clear message from the Congress that it is time for us to change course,"" says museum's director. ""It is time to do that,"" he says."
"Inspiring Impressionism is organized by the Denver Art Museum. It opened Tuesday at the High, to run there through January 2008. With the backing of Northern Trust, the show will then travel to Denver February 23 to May 25, 2008."
Inspiring Impressionism at the High Museum of Art is one of the most popular art shows in the U.S. The High is hosting the show on the same time frame as the second year of the Louvre Atlanta show. See a gallery of images from the show.
"The Louvre and the Ancient World and the companion show The Eye of Josephine look at some of the oldest treasures in the Louvres vast holdings. The emphasis here, however, is on what older works may have moved and motivated such artists as Claude Monet, PierreAuguste Renoir and Paul Cézanne."
"Inspiring Impressionism is a new show at the Louvre Atlanta. The show looks at the tradition of modernera artists learning by studying the work of Louvre masters. The Beggar Boy of around 1650 is one of the mostcopied canvases in Western arts modern history. Even olderera echoes of this same concept are encountered on looking at Louvre Atlantas The Tiber marble from the first century A.D. So a surprise symmetry takes shape at the High this fall, as visitors contemplate dialogues between museums theLouvre, the High, Denver, Seattle, the viewers of art in Europe and the United States, and the artists themselves."
"High director Michael Shapiro calls these synchronicities visual evidence of connections. Dont miss some of the comments and writings of various artists, used as part of the display of the show at the High. Degas may have said it most honestly No art is less spontaneous than mine. What I do is the result of refection and the study of the Old Masters."
"Nemanja Vidic will partner Rio Ferdinand in the heart of the United defense. Vidic sat out Saturdays 41 victory at Aston Villa after suffering concussion during the Premier League win over Wigan. Sir Alex Ferguson has convinced Vidic that he should play in Tuesday's Champions League clash away to Dynamo Kiev. Joining Northern trust Corporation in funding the exhibition are the National Endowment for the Humanities, and support is also provided by an indemnity from the Federal Council on the Arts and the humanities."
Louis Saha definitely misses the tie with a longterm knee problem. Gary Neville and Owen Hargreaves also stayed behind. England striker Wayne Rooney will partner Carlos Tevez in attack. A third successive victory after 10 wins against Sporting Lisbon and Roma would virtually guarantee United a place in the knockout stage.
"Pape Diakhate, Ismael Bangoura and Taras Mykhalyk are expected to return for Dynamo. Former Tottenham forward Serhiy Rebrov is an absentee. Glasgow Rangers are without JeanClaude Darcheville and Brahim Hemdani for their formidable home clash against Barcelona on Tuesday."
Franck Ribery set to miss Bayern Munich's UEFA Cup tie against Red Star Belgrade. The French international hurt his thigh in Saturdays 21 win at Bochum. Darren Darcheville still struggling with a hamstring problem while Hemdani misses the Group E tie in Glasgow with a groin problem. Some Democrats appear to be wavering on a highly contentious House resolution labeling Turkeys treatment of Armenians in World War I as genocide.
"Turkey is incensed by the resolution calling the killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks genocide. It threatened to block access to Incirlik Air Base after the resolution passed a House committee vote. The base, in southern Turkey near Syria, is a major resupply center for U.S. operations in Iraq and elsewhere in the Mideast and Asia."
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would bring the measure to a vote of the full House sometime next month. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer signaled Tuesday that the vote might be put off. Bush administration urged Congress to drop the issue. Some leading Democrats urged Pelosi not to bring it to the floor.
"Democratic Reps. Alcee Hastings and John Tanner urge Pelosi to reconsider. More than half of the cargo flown into Iraq and Afghanistan comes through Incirlik Air Base. Pentagon planners are looking at a broad range of options to keep food, fuel and ammunition flowing to U.S. troops in Iraq if Turkey blocks the air base, an official says. The House Armed Services Committee chairman announced his opposition to the resolution last week."
"Defense Secretary Robert Gates echoed lawmakers concerns last week. About 70 percent of all air cargo going into Iraq goes through Turkey. 95 percent of the MineResistant AmbushProtective vehicles, or MRAPs, are deployed in Iraq. About a third of the fuel that they consume go through Turkey or comes from Turkey."
"The U.S. military issued a warning order a few days ago to ensure that alternative air crews, planes, fuel and routes are lined up. Jordan and Kuwait are among the alternatives the United States is considering. Some fear pursuit of the resolution would also embolden the Turks to attack Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq."
"Incirlik offers 10,000 and 9,000foot runways and 57 hardened aircraft shelters. Incirlik has become a hub for cargo shipments to Iraq, taking over for RheinMain Air Base in Germany. Milan goalkeeper Dida has been cleared to play in next months Champions League match at Shakhtar Donetsk after partially winning his appeal to UEFA against a twomatch ban."
"Brazilian Dida is suspended for two matches by European football's ruling body. Dida was initially banned for two games for his theatrics following a Celtic fans encroachment onto the pitch during the 21 defeat at Celtic Park. The 34-year-old will only serve the second match of his ban if he commits a similar offense  during the next 12 months, freeing him for the trip to Shakhtar on Wednesday. He was also fined 60,000 Swiss francs by UEFA following an incident involving a supporter during the Champions clash against Celtic."
"UEFA said that their Appeals Body took note that Dida expressed his sincere regrets as regards his conduct during the match. AC Milan vicepresident Adriano Galliani was satisfied with UEFAs decision. I believe it is fair  I was against the twogame suspension but one seems OK. Dida has made a mistake but his error did not hinder anyone, not Celtic, nor any player."
"Dube, 43, was killed in Johannesburg around 8 p.m. local time Thursday. Police said he was shot after someone tried to steal his car. Dube was much loved by his fellow South Africans. His death cast a shadow over festivities ahead of the rugby World Cup final this weekend."
"Callers to talk radio stations suggested the Springboks wear black armbands in remembrance of Dube when they take to the field Saturday in Paris. South Africa is one of the most dangerous societies in the world. Figures from the South African Police Service show that from April 2006 to March 2007, more than 19,000 South Africans were murdered."
Dube had just returned from a tour of the United States that stretched from California to New York. His record company said Dube leaves a great void in the music industry after a 25year career.
"Dube recorded 22 albums in Zulu, English and Afrikaans. Born outside Johannesburg in 1964, Dube was named Lucky by his mother because he was the first child to be born after several failed pregnancies. Dube started singing in 1982, joining a band playing Mbaqanga, or traditional Zulu music."
"Lucky was not just an extraordinary artist, he was a personal friend, Haarburger said. Dube is survived by his wife, Zanele, and his seven children Bongi, Nonkululeko, Thokozani, Laura, Siyanda, Philani and threemonth old Melokuhle."
" Nationwide Airlines Boeing 737 Flight CE723 was able to fly long enough to dump fuel. 100 hundred people were on the plane that departed at 350 p.m. on an hourlong flight to Johannesburg, South Africa. The jet had only been in the air about 10 minutes before the engine fell."
"We heard something crash and bang, the plane veering left and right. A person on the right side said the engine was missing  had broken clean off. They flew us in very slowly. We were all prepared for the worst."
"We went into the fetal position, head between the legs, he said. Then we hit the runway. I did kind of pray. I didnt want to die."
An object had been sucked into the engine as the nose wheel lifted from the ground. The enginetowing supporting structure is designed to release an engine when extreme forces are applied. The captain heard a loud noise immediately followed by a yaw of the aircraft sideways slippage to the right.
"Nationwide said the engine had undergone a major overhaul in March 2005 at an approved Federal Aviation Authority facility in the U.S.A. Pelser said he spent the night in Cape Town, then flew back to Johannesburg where he lives, on the same airline. These engines typically achieve 10,000 hours between major overhauls, Nationwide Airlines said."
"President Bush signed a federal disaster declaration Wednesday, freeing up federal funds for families affected by the wildfires in seven counties in Southern California. FEMA Director David Paulison promised on Tuesday a different type of response than the federal government put together for Katrina. Paulison said Katrina was a wakeup call and that this is a new FEMA."
"The action follows an emergency declaration by Bush on Tuesday morning for the counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. FEMA and other relief and rescue services face significantly different challenges in the fire zone than they did on the Gulf Coast in 2005. For example, the fires arent covering every square foot of the region, as Katrina did."
"The devastation in California is intense but not universal. By contrast, roads in Southern California have remained open for residents to get out and help to get in without delay. Residents there are generally more affluent and are able to use their own vehicles to escape. Many of Katrinas victims were poor and had no means of transportation."
"FEMA and other relief agencies are able to stage supplies and meet victims needs in an organized way. San Diegos Qualcomm Stadium is not endangered by the fires. New Orleans Superdome, on the other hand, was severely damaged by hurricane winds and threatened by rising water."
"Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff acknowledged Tuesday that the governments response machinery had benefited from the Katrina experience. ""I think theres no question that there were a couple of the lessons from Katrina which we have put into effect here,"" he said. ""We have really flooded the zone as quickly as possible by staging assets"""
"Chertoff said federal officials began discussing over the weekend the need to have FEMA ready, and as we saw the evacuation issue becoming more prominent, we sprang into action. So weve been monitoring the situation continuously. Weve been on top of it. And were going to continue to stay ahead of this as far as we can."
Chertoff said Tuesday that he hadnt waited for the paperwork to be signed before staging assistance. People left homeless by the fires can already go online to apply for federal help at www.fema.gov. Weve also moved air assets to be poised to take flight once the winds begin to die down.
"The U.S. military has sent aircraft to help fight the fires. More than 17,000 National Guardsmen have been made available. 550 Marines were ready for deployment from Camp Pendleton. The late Chris Benoit idolized the Dynamite Kid, who was half of a professional wrestling team famous in the 1980s for spectacular highflying, acrobatic moves."
"Chris Benoit strangled his wife and suffocated his son before hanging himself in June. The Dynamite Kid and his partner, Davey Boy Smith, were known as the British Bulldogs. They won the World Wrestling Federation tag team championship in 1986."
"In June, Benoit murdered his wife and young son before hanging himself. Investigators found testosterone, painkillers and antianxiety drugs in Chris Benoits body. Billington now lives in a public housing apartment outside Manchester, England."
"He has lost the use of his legs. A pin sticks out from one of his toes. Billington blames his wrestling life for doing this to him. And from the steroids, he said."
"Vince McMahon tells CNN nothing from the WWE had anything to do with Chris Benoit murdering his family. Benoits death has refocused a media spotlight on the organization for which he wrestled, now known as World Wrestling Entertainment. McMahon, appearing with Linda McMahon, his wife and WWE CEO, told CNN Nothing from the. WWE, under any set of circumstances had any involvement in Benoit's murder."
"Vince McMahon defended the organization, saying its drugtesting policy was not just for show. Critics say McMahon pushes his stars and nonstars, works them too many nights per year. They say McMahon only looks at his employees as commodities, pawns in a huge business."
"About 16 million people a week tune into WWE TV shows. Two of their cable programs  Raw and Friday Night Smackdown are weekly ratings giants. Payperview specials generate an average of 100 million per year. When asked about the high number of former wrestlers who had died before they turned 50 years old, Vince McMahon said each person in the WWE bore responsibility for their own lives."
"The McMahons say the WWE is taking steps toward improving its oversight of its athletes. Since the newest WWE drug screening program began in February 2006, more than 30 of the organizations wrestlers have been suspended. David Black who helped the NFL develop its drug program and now runs tests for the WWE says twice that number have tested positive and been given a warning."
"Dr. Gary Wadler, a worldrenowned expert in the study of drugs and athletes, says the WWE is not doing enough. Wadler was referring to the U.S. AntiDoping Agency in Colorado Springs, Colorado."
"U.S. athletes training for the Olympics are randomly tested and, if caught just once, face a twoyear suspension from competition. If caught a second time, they can be banned for life."
" McMahon denies that his wrestlers are pushed to use steroids. He says the average wrestler is lighter than in recent years. Theres an expression in our business, that here is where you make your money."
"Its your face, its what you do with it, he said. Its your delivery, your elocution. Its storyline, its things."
"Mental Floss  Everyone goes through a rebellious phase. And, if youre lucky, youll be able to look back on those years and laugh. In modern times, cats frolic among the ruins of ancient Rome. But, hey, it could be worse."
"Justa Grata Honoria was a Roman princess who rebelled against her brother's reign. Her wild ways and literally naked ambition set off a chain reaction that culminated in the destruction of the Roman Empire. Smart, conniving, and ruthless, Honoria possessed all the attributes befitting a Roman emperor, except for that pesky Y chromosome. Her afterhours habits caused quite the scandal, but they failed to satiate her need for attention and power."
"Honoria was sent to a convent in Constantinople. She spent her years at the nunnery plotting one escape attempt after another. She seduced her brothers royal chamberlain, Eugenius, and together, they plotted to murder Valentinian and seize power."
"Honoria offered Attila half of the Western Empire as her dowry. If Attila would rescue her, she would marry him. Of course, Honoria was in no position to rightfully offer any portion of the Roman Empire. She turned to sources outside the empire."
"Attila had secretly been planning a move against Rome for years. Wasting no time, he told Valentinian that he planned to marry Honoria, and demanded the dowry hed been promised. Naturally, Valentinian refused, and Attila used his status as a wronged husband to invade Roman territory in 451 C.E."
"Like all the other cities before it, Rome would also have been annihilated were it not for the famine and disease that devastated the Huns during the invasion. Rome survived with the unlikely help of another nomadic enemy tribe, the Visigoths, but the Western Empire never recovered. Within a generation, the armies of the Goths, Franks, and Huns had overrun the area."
"Not wanting to cause a scandal by having her executed, Valentinian settled on a suitable third option. After years of struggle, Honoria finally suffered the fate she had been dreading all along. She was married off to an elderly Roman senator, and the rest of her life went unrecorded by history. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com."
FIFA chief Blatter was among those in Sheffield to kick off the 150th birthday celebrations of footballs oldest club. Other guests attending a dinner in the clubs honor included Real Madrid President Ramon Calderon and England and Manchester United legend Bobby Charlton. Pele  widely recognized as the greatest footballer ever to play the game  is also due in town next month to attend Sheffield FCs clash with Inter. The Italian giants are scheduled to play a friendly against Sheffield FC next month.
Sheffield FC was instrumental in developing set rules for the game. The club studied existing rules and laid down a code of laws. By 1862 there were said to be 15 football clubs in and around the Sheffield area. The Football Association which codified the basic rules of the modern game was established in London the following year.
"Sheffield FC has never played at a professional level. The club currently competes in the Unibond Leagues First Division South, seven divisions beneath the English Premier League. The city of Sheffield has two professional clubs  United and Wednesday who both currently play in English footballs second tier, the CocaCola Championship. The sight of the players using their foreheads in addition to their feet reduced the London crowd to hysterics."
"Sheffield FC's proudest achievement on the pitch came in 1904 when the team beat Ealing 31 to win the FA Amateur Cup in front of 6,000 people. 100 years later in 2004, Blatter presented Sheffield FC with FIFAs Order of Merit an honor previously awarded only to the ninetime European champions Real Madrid. Long before they ever made an appearance on the TV show Sex and the City, pointed shoes were favored by Polish nobles."
"In 1363 the English attempted to rein in the look by law, assigning shoe spans to social classes. Commoners could sport footwear with toes of up to six inches, while those in the royal ranks were allowed a full two feet in length. In 1977 University of Vermont student Lisa Lindahl was running 30 miles a week and her bra wasnt holding up."
"With the help of two classmates, Lindahl sewed together two jock straps and  presto! the sports bra was born. Almost 40,000 sports bras are now sold annually."
"Mary Jane was either Buster Browns sweetheart or sister, depending on which source you consult. Gabardine, a waterrepellent fabric invented by Burberry, got its first mention from Shakespeare. The most widely held theory is that the singlestrapped footwear was named for a character in Buster Brown."
"The Bard used the word in The Merchant of Venice to refer to a coarse cloak worn as protection from storms. During World War I, British officers on the front lines kept warm and dry in a uniform coat made of the material  the original Burberry trench."
Palm Beach socialite Lilly Pulitzer opened a juice stand in 1959 to pass the time. The citrus concoctions discolored her clothes. She instructed her dressmaker to create a uniform that would camouflage the bright stains. The Lilly design  sleeveless cotton shifts in vibrant prints was born.
"The term pump first popped up in 1550 in England, where male servants sported the style. It is said that the noise they made while wearing the loosefitting shoes resembled the sound of a water pump. The word sneaker entered the language in the 1870s the rubber soles made the shoes quiet and therefore sneaky."
"The modern usage of stiletto, a Renaissanceera Italian word for an assassins narrowbladed knife, made its debut in 1953. When it rained, the welltodo stayed dry in covered carriages and sedan chairs. For thousands of years, in such places as Egypt, China, Japan, Mesopotamia, and India, umbrellas were used exclusively to shade the heads of dignitaries."
"Bikinis first appeared in 1946, but American women thought them immodest. Not until the 1960s were they accepted, possibly helped by the hit song Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini. Named for the nucleartesting site Bikini Atoll."
"It is said that the cuffs were designed to be used as handkerchiefs in combat. But, in fact, French royalty invented the style in the 1500s. Amusingly, the competitive English tried to take credit for the fashion."
"Around 1800, thinner, silkier fabrics and slimmer cuts came into vogue. Women could no longer hide the bulging sacks around their midsections. They began carrying their belongings in small pocketbooks instead. In the 16th century, drawers became a common term for both mens and womens underpants."
"Made of linen, the items were nofrills and looked more or less interchangeable this being well before Victoria ever had a secret decorative lace trim. Most likely, underwear earned this distinctly unsexy epithet because it describes the way that people put on their unmentionables."
"Ronaldinho has been recalled to the Barcelona squad for Tuesday's Champions League match against Rangers in Glasgow. The Brazilian was dropped from the squad that lost 31 to Villarreal on Saturday after returning late from international duty. Barca will be without Deco for that match though, after the Portuguese suffered a thigh injury that will keep him sidelined for around five weeks. Samuel Etoo, Yaya Toure, Gianluca Zambrotta, Edmilson and Rafael Marquez are also missing from the 18-man squad."
"Jared Hutchins says the Beatles made him irritable and angry. Hutchins plays the piano, guitar and harmonica. The rallies, which draw mostly teens, are one part concert, one part Christian revival. ""God owns my life, not the Beatles, he said simply."
"Hutchins is one of many teenagers who say that some part of popular culture has harmed him. Hutchins said he enjoys a wide range of music from Pink Floyd and Arcade Fire to Christian bands such as Hillsong United. He said he has to be careful of what music he listens to, for the same reason he temporarily turned off the Beatles. Go behindthescenes with CNNs Christiane Amanpour at a BattleCry event."
"The rallies seek to stage a reverse revolution against secular popular culture. The audiences are nearly always predominantly teenagers and young adults. From 2006 to 2007, a total of 127,830 people attended the 34 Acquire the Fire rallies. The three BattleCry events held in San Francisco, California Detroit, Michigan and Bristow, Virginia."
"Teen Mania founder Ron Luce has waged a crusade against purveyors of popular culture, whom he has condemned as the enemy. Luce: We dont have to be branded by the culture, we are branded by God. Be who God created you to be, Teen Mania followers say. For Hutchins, who said he struggled in his early adolescence to fit in and be cool, the message is exactly right."
"More than two decades old, Teen Mania estimates it has reached more than 2 million teens with its message of living completely for Christ. In addition to its live stadium rallies, there are BattleCry shirts and hats, mobile screen savers, books and a television program. There are international mission trips  Hutchins attended one in Tijuana, Mexico, this summer."
"He weaves disturbing statistics about teenagers amid his gospel. Todays teenagers are in crisis, he says. Were fighting for those who dont know they have a voice, that are being manipulated by our pop culture, Luce says."
"To some, Luces rhetoric is offputting, hateful and divisive. Opponents point to his views on homosexuality  not in Gods plan and abortion  the ending of a precious life. It is this criticism that Luce and his followers confronted headon in March at BattleCry San Francisco. There, in arguably the most liberal city in the United States, protesters rallied against BattleCry on the steps of City Hall."
"Ron Luce is a liar! Let me hear you say Christian fascist, another yelled. Luce and the youths, some as young as 11, also raised their voices. Mindy Peterson is a member of Teen Manias Honor Academy."
"Afterward, Peterson railed against what she said was the protesters mischaracterization of BattleCry. ""These people think that our war is against other people,"" she said."
"While much milder in his terms, Hutchins agrees. Were a generation that is kind of troubled, he said. Luce wants to rescue the hearts of our generation, he added."
"Mostly, what were concerned with is Jesus. One afternoon the shells began raining down on our neighborhood in Beirut. The civil war was in full flood."
"A Lebanese woman and her son run through west Beirut in 1989 during fighting between rival forces. We ran from school screaming. Out of breath, my knees giving way, it seemed to take forever to reach our local shelter. The memory of that terrifying afternoon receded until recently."
"After more than a decade of relative peace and reconstruction, the bombings and assassinations have returned to Beirut. In 1988, I watched the last throes of the civil war firsthand and like millions of Lebanese, sad, frustrated and often fearful. Now I watch from another continent, but I find those same emotions resurfacing."
"The conspiracies, the car bombs, the threatening rhetoric and political deadlock are eerily familiar. Then, as now, a presidential election is the setting. The struggle where religion and clan play the main roles threatens to set Lebanon back 20 years."
"In 1988, the presidents term was coming to an end and the warring factions were unable to agree on a new candidate. Militias prevented parliament members from reaching the assembly building. Compromise was nowhere in sight."
"In his last act as president, Amin Gemayel named fellow Christian and Army Chief Michel Aoun as prime minister. At a stroke, he shattered the convention that a Muslim hold that position."
Aoun famously declared I am prime minister and six ministers in one. War of Liberation against Syria turned into defeat. He turned on fellow Christians of the Lebanese Forces in the War of Elimination.
"I tried to explain the chaos, the bewildering array of factions and the horrors of civil war for ordinary civilians. I had seen people killed in front of me children orphaned in seconds, parents burying their infants in oversize white coffins. So when I was offered the opportunity to stay at CNN, I gratefully accepted the chance to escape the anarchy."
"Peace came to Lebanon, but it would be five years before I returned. In 1995, I went back and was stunned. I couldnt believe that I could go anywhere without being harassed or kidnapped. No longer did identity  Christian, Muslim or Druze define where Lebanese could go."
"Downtown Beirut, once rocked by explosions and bullet holes, was rocking to Lebanese pop music. The dusty sandbags had given way to boutiques carrying the latest European fashions and deluxe hotels. Lovers had returned to Beiruts Corniche, overlooking the Mediterranean, for romantic strolls at sunset."
"The agreement that ended the civil war was more a truce than a real settlement. As antiSyrian sentiment grew, so did political tensions. On Valentines Day 2005, the Corniche was once again rocked by an explosion."
"On the day of love, Lebanon was thrown back into its most hateful history. It had been widely expected that Hariri would run for office again and demand the withdrawal of Syrian troops. But Hariris death also exposed the fault lines that had broken Lebanon a generation previously."
"Even after it withdrew its troops, Syria still had allies in Lebanon. One was Hezbollah, accused of the suicide attacks that had killed scores of U.S. Marines in Beirut. Another was Gen. Michel Aoun, who had defied Syria in 1989, but now made common cause with Hezbollah against his fellow Christians."
"The place looked like a morgue. Antigovernment Hezbollah squatters had brought life there to a standstill. As I passed through, business owners stood silent in the sun. I wondered if they sensed my disappointment, my pain at watching Beirut bleed again."
"Once again, the term of the president is approaching its end there is no agreement on his successor. Suspicion and fear are the political currency of the day. Will the countrys brief renaissance that so amazed me in 1995 be snuffed out by the old curse of sectarian rivalries? CNNs Joe Sterling, David Ariosto, Saad Abedine and Tracy Doueiry contributed to this report."
"Firefighters were aided by resources from Mexico, the state and federal governments and even inmates from Californias prisons. San Diego Fire Department Battalion Chief Bruce Cartelli described scenes of utter devastation with hundreds of homes lost and many hundreds of others damaged."
Meteorologists suggest Santa Ana winds could die down Wednesday afternoon. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff: We are still facing some very serious fires. The weather has made it very difficult for the air assets to get up and fight the fires.
"Officials have evacuated nearly 350,000 homes in San Diego County alone. Using U.S. Census Bureau numbers from the 2000 census, that could mean as many as 950,000 were affected. At least half a million residents had been ordered to find refuge in shelters, schools and stadiums."
"More than 12,000 people have been evacuated from their homes. Qualcomm Stadium is serving as a shelter for the evacuees. The San Diego Chargers planned to practice at the Arizona Cardinals stadium in Glendale for next weekends game. The stadium is being used as a temporary shelter until the stadium is ready for full-time use. The fires are burning in the San Diego area."
"Lake Arrowhead resident Michelle Dresser was chased from her home by a wildfire last year. She spent the night in her store, partly to help customers and neighbors. ""We are surrounded by fire on both sides,"" she says."
"Chertoff arrives in San Diego for a firsthand look at the devastation. President Bush is scheduled to visit the area on Thursday. Chertoff says the federal response to the wildfires is phenomenally better than the response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, because we have been preparing and planning and training together for the last 2 ½ years."
"Unlike in Katrina... we have now built the process... and weve rehearsed it, so when we take the field, the team already knows what we need to do. Arnold Schwarzenegger said he was heartbroken after touring the Lake Arrowhead area. The Grass Valley and Slide fires have burned 5,000 acres and destroyed more than 200 homes."
"Dry terrain, searing heat and hammering winds had created the perfect storm for fire, governor says. Schwarzenegger said about 7,000 firefighters were battling the blazes. San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders said the mayor of Tijuana, Mexico, had sent four fire engines and their crews to help out."
"The Witch fire in the north is the priority because of its significant threat to structures. The Harris fire had burned more than 70,000 acres by midmorning. At least 150 National Guard members are assigned to provide security at the stadium."
"The Ranch, Buckweed, and Magic fires have charred more than 93,000 acres. The blazes are straddling the L.A.Ventura County line. The Ranch fire was only two miles away from the 1,200acre Magic fire."
"Asked if he had enough resources, Parker said, We truly dont. Were using a limited amount of resources to go in and fight these fires. Weve got about 600 people on the Ranch fire we normally would have about 1,500. So we have to be absolutely surgical in how we plan and how we tactically use our fire equipment."
"Other transmission lines have been destroyed. Mexicos Federal Electrical Commission is providing power to the areas grid to help make up for the losses. California also received extensive offers of manpower and equipment from the military. A total of 550 Marines were ready for deployment from Camp Pendleton, north of San Diego."
"The Red Cross has set up 11 shelters in the area and housed 3,000 people Monday night. The Red Cross and other groups also were in the wings. They and some other groups were waiting for the flames to die down before bringing in their volunteers."
Every one of us out here feels like these homes are our own. We know what its like to see peoples faces when theyve lost everything. Its devastating to see so much of this all at once.
"Sallie Krawcheck is Chairman and Chief Executive of Citi Global Wealth Management. Dubbed the Mrs Clean of Wall Street, she was credited with restoring investors faith in analyst reports. She joined Citigroup in 2002, and spent some time as Chief Financial Officer before taking up her current role in March 2007."
"Sallie Krawcheck has been a regular entrant on Fortunes list of the Worlds Most Powerful Women in Business. John Defterios caught up with Ms Kraw check in Dubai. He asked her for her views on the movement of capital outside the G8 Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States."
"Over time, youre really going to see... a shift in economic activity on a relative basis from the more developed economies here to the Middle East as well as Asia. Its coming almost as a perfect storm we have a sub prime crisis, a 20 percent fall in the dollar in the last two years. Yes, the investments are going up globally, but the governments here really are investing back in the infrastructure and the economies of this region."
"In this window of time, is there a danger that the financial capitals build outside of Wall Street and it undermines its role? I think there is no doubt that New York is losing its status as a financial capital of the world. But you have overlapping regulators in the United States, you have very high taxes in the U.S. and you have the emerging markets coming up."
"Some of the wealth funds are now on the radar of both Wall Street and Capitol Hill in Washington. You cant have your cake and eat it too. Some of the things are negative for the United States, some of which are positive for the other regions."
"Sovereign funds are very important drivers of global markets and global liquidity. The concern is if, gee these are going to be important going forward, we want to have these involved in our economy and our markets. If we regulate this alone that money will skitter away to another market  to a market outside the United States or Europe for example. Its fascinating because if you look at Qatar or Egypt or Shanghai, the stock markets have almost had like a one way path."
"But what are we likely to see here, stair steps up the ladder with some corrections along the way, or an implosion because of the rapid gains? SK I think youve got to separate the idea of whats going on in the real economies and whats going onto in the market places. They move together, but sometimes they separate, they diverge, and they can diverge for a long period of time."
"For 30 years its been growing at that kind of rate and really can continue as far as the eye can see. So, say the same thing for the Middle East, the growth even at a lower oil price can be significant, but can be high single digit or double digit for some foreseeable period going forward. Are we ready for a woman to take over a money center bank?"
"I think we are getting ready as a country, to potentially have a woman run a money center bank. If you look across Wall Street, there are a few women who are putting themselves in positions to be successors the next time there are CEOs who move along. I think its a very exciting development for the industry and for the country. The board wouldnt ask and I wouldnt accept, but I would be open to it."
"The Santiago Fire in Orange County was started in two places along a littletraveled road. The fire, which has burned more than 25,000 acres, is a confirmed arson. It spread rapidly, indicating the arsonist had some knowledge of winds and other factors."
"There was evidence found at the scene. That is the purpose of our early declaration of it being an arsoncaused fire, Prather said."
"The reward for information leading to an arrest has increased to 250,000  50,000 each from the governors office, the U.S. agency of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the FBI. KFI radio has chipped in another 100,000, the sheriffs department said."
"About 1,100 firefighters were working on controlling the Santiago Fire. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said the fire was only 30 percent contained Thursday morning. The Santiago Fire has destroyed at least 22 structures, according to Orange County Fire Battalion Chief Kris Concepcion."
"Thats the part that I really cant figure out, to tell you the truth, he told CNN. That individual knew on Sunday when this fire started that we had, really, the perfect storm, if you will. The smaller Rosa Fire in Riverside County, 100 percent contained at 411 acres Thursday morning, was also probably arson, state officials said."
"Catalino Pineda, 41, was arrested Wednesday. Witnesses told police they saw him lighting a fire on a hillside. He was already on probation for making excessive false emergency reports to police. His bail has been set at 75,000, a police spokeswoman says. The fires are burning in the San Fernando Valley northwest of Los Angeles."
"In San Bernardino County, John Alfred Rund, 48, was arrested Tuesday evening and charged with setting a small fire along a rural roadside near Victorville. The countys district attorneys office on Thursday also filed arson charges against Anthony Riperti, 47, of Redlands."
"A statement from the office did not say when or where Riperti is accused of setting a fire. He is being held on 250,000 bail and will be arraigned later Thursday. The Vista Fire Department extinguished the blaze before it grew out of control."
"Investigators have determined that the Grass Valley Fire in San Bernardino County was not caused by arson. Preliminary investigation into the cause of the 10,152acre Slide Fire seems to indicate arson was not a factor. Winds that gusted as much as 101 mph on Sunday dropped to about 30 mph Wednesday evening."
"The dry Santa Ana winds that have fanned the flames, changed direction and began blowing inland from the Pacific Ocean. The winds are increasing the humidity and easing the burden on almost 8,900 firefighters. But the destruction was taking its toll on the men and women on the front lines of the fires."
"As conditions improved, officials allowed people to return to communities that had been offlimits. The change in the weather also meant that firefighting aircraft grounded for most of the week by the winds could finally fly. ""We had been there 28 years, and it had a lot of our flavor,"" says Mark Davis, whose house burned to the ground."
"Scott McLean called the droning sound of aircraft the sound of joy. The rate of burning had slowed significantly by Wednesday. Still, the fire damage increased to 434,543 acres."
"The Witch fire in San Diego County is 10 percent contained. It burned about 196,000 acres before combining with the smaller Poomacha blaze. Seven fires among the 22 counted Wednesday were contained. That amounted to 679 square miles, or about 10 times the size of Washington, D.C."
"The Santiago fire has burned more than 19,000 acres. All three of its points of origin have been declared crime scenes. A 70,000 reward is being offered for any information leading to the arrest of those responsible."
"The smaller Rosa fire in Riverside County is also a probably arson. Helicopters are back in the air over the Lake Arrowhead, California, area. In nearby Running Springs, CNNs Ted Rowlands stood in the midst of charred, smoldering rubble strewn with potentially deadly power lines. The fire is 70 percent contained at just over 400 acres."
"It will be a while before these people will come back, Rowlands says. About 500 homes were lost in the mountainous region in San Bernardino County east of Los Angeles."
"The fires have already destroyed 1,664 structures including 1,436 homes, Schwarzenegger says. The blazes have killed three people and left 40 hurt, he says. President Bush signed a major disaster declaration Wednesday. The governor will fly over the area Thursday with President Bush."
"The cost of homes destroyed by the wildfires is likely to top 1 billion in San Diego County alone, an emergency official said. People left homeless by the fires can go online to apply for federal help at FEMA.gov. There were 76,000 people staying in the 42 shelters opened inSan Diego County Wednesday morning."
"Sudanese court finds British teacher guilty of insulting religion. Gillian Gibbons sentenced to 15 days in prison for allowing a teddy bear to be named Mohammed. Qualcomm Stadium housed 11,000 evacuees at the peak of the disaster. That number dropped to 5,000 Wednesday morning, officials said."
"Gillian Gibbons also faces deportation from Sudan after her prison term. Gibbons, 54, was arrested Sunday after she asked her class of 7yearolds in Khartoum to name the stuffed animal. She had faced charges under Article 125 of Sudans constitution, the law relating to insulting religion and inciting hatred."
"Although there is no ban in the Quran on images of Allah or the Prophet Mohammed, likenesses are considered highly offensive by Muslims. Appearing somber and dazed, Gibbons arrived at the central courthouse in Khartoum for her closed hearing early Thursday."
"Gibbons could have faced a sentence of 40 lashes, a fine, or a jail term of up to a year. Foreign Office expressed Britains dissatisfaction with the verdict. Foreign Secretary David Miliband called in the Sudanese ambassador, Omer Siddig, this evening to explain the decision and discuss next steps. He said: ""Our clear view is that this is an innocent misunderstanding by a dedicated teacher"""
"Gibbons will be given credit for the four days since her arrest, Foreign Office says. She has 11 days remaining on her sentence. Miliband met with Siddig, who was summoned to the Foreign Office in London."
"Around 25 police linked arms and forced journalists and British officials away from the court entrance. Police detained some journalists, and confiscated a camera belonging to a freelance CNN cameraman. Four vans filled with riot police were waiting outside the courthouse, but there were no signs of street disturbances or protests."
"Staff from Gibbons school, including Robert Boulos, the head of Unity High School, were present. Boulos said he was horrified when he found out that the complaint about the naming of the bear came from a member of his own staff. Gibbons has been working at the school  popular with wealthy Sudanese and expatriates since August."
"He said Gibbons asked the children to pick their favorite name for the new class mascot, which she was using to aid lessons about animals and their habitats. The owner of a North Carolina beach house where seven college students died in a weekend fire said Monday that his familys lives were just changed forever by the tragedy."
"Chip Auman said his 18yearold daughter survived the fire but was hospitalized and in stable condition because of complications from smoke inhalation. ""The thought of losing a child is unimaginable to me, and as a father my heart goes out to the families that lost a loved one in this situation,"" he said."
"Two college campuses mourned Monday. Six University of South Carolina students and a Clemson University student died in the fire early Sunday morning in Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina. Authorities from the state Bureau of Investigation and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are leading the investigation into the cause of the fire."
The house was engulfed in flames when the fire department arrived on the scene. The flames shot into the sky and ultimately left little more than portions of the framing. Investigators have said it would be Tuesday or Wednesday before the identities of the victims are confirmed publicly.
"It could be as much as a month until investigators know the cause of the fire, Pruitt says. The university did not cancel classes on Monday, but arrangements had been made for those who need to go home or stay out of class. Pruitt said meetings had been held Sunday with members of Delta Delta Delta sorority and Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity."
"The university president contacted the families of those who died in the fire to express the condolences and support of the university community. Jay Laura, student president of the USC chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said the campus would pull together after the tragedy. If any place can come together to help in the healing process and the aftermath of an event like this, it is South Carolina, Laura said."
"He was just yelling at me to jump and stuff, Wylie says. The smoke was pouring out, couldnt really breathe, so I had to make a quick decision. I just kind of leaned out the window and luckily I jumped far enough to make it into the canal."
"George Smith, who lives across the street from the house, said he heard sirens between 630 and 7 a.m. and went outside to see the whole sky lit up. The whole house was completely engulfed in flames, up to about 20 feet, he said."
"Linda Sing said she was walking her dog when she saw the fiery destruction. She noted that firefighters had saved an adjacent house by spraying it down with water. We knew there were people in there, but we hoped and prayed theyd gotten out."
"Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez says he is cutting all ties with Colombia. Uribe withdrew his support for the Venezuelan leaders mediation efforts with the FARC. Ocean Isle Beach is a popular resort destination along North Carolinas southern coast. The yearround population of the 7milelong island is about 425, but it swells to about 25,000 during the summer season."
"Chavez says Uribe asked him to help secure the release of hostages being held by the leftist rebel group FARC and the National Liberation Army ELN. Uribe ended Chavezs participation, citing his direct communication with Uribes top general, a move that Uribe said broke protocol. ""I was prepared to go to the most dangerous forest in the country to help,"" Chavez says."
Chavez accuses Uribe of having lied. He says Uribe bowed to pressure from Washington to get rid of Chavez. But the firebrand Venezuelan president says his arms are open to the Colombian people. He has called U.S. President George W. Bush the devil..
Ann Curley has been a type I diabetic for 40 years. She uses a pump attached to a catheter in her body to monitor glucose levels and administer insulin. This is her story of life with diabetes.
"Dr. Robert Deputy was the pediatrician who diagnosed me with diabetes. He spoke to me directly, rather than to my mother, and he asked me questions Did I feel thirsty? Did I need to urinate during the night? The answer to both questions was yes."
"He asked for a urine sample and the result was immediate. Dr. Deputy told me and my mother that my body wasnt processing sugar properly. I spent several days in the hospital learning how to manage my disease, and then they sent me home."
"Dr. Deputy would call our house each afternoon to check on me and see how I was doing. I refused to let my parents give me injections or test my urine. While some diabetics may feel their disease is a burden, I feel that being diagnosed with diabetes was a blessing in disguise."
"It forced our family to eat healthily, and it taught me about good nutrition. I know carbohydrate counts in most foods, and I understand dietary concepts that most people dont even care about. Being active is also a way to burn off high blood sugar, so when my urine tested positive for glucose, my older sister Robin was in charge of exercising me. We had countless jumprope contests, bike rides and rollerskating excursions."
"Test strips were developed that could be dipped in urine to reveal whether sugar was present in it. But the truth is, testing urine for sugar was a primitive method. By the time sugar gets into the urine, its a signal that the body doesnt have enough insulin to process sugar."
"Home blood glucose testing kits became available in the early 1980s. With the kit, the diabetic uses a device to poke a finger and produce a drop of blood. The blood is placed on a test strip that fits into a device that produces a reading."
"The 1980s also saw the advent of the insulin pump. This device is the size of a pager and contains a reservoir filled with insulin. The reservoir connects to a tube that infuses the insulin into the body with a tiny plastic shunt. So rather than taking multiple injections to mimic the bodys insulin patterns, the pump drips insulin into. the body to keep blood sugars constant."
"The continuous glucose monitor, or CGM, is a small device inserted into the tissue usually the abdomen, hip or leg. It has a tiny sensor that reads the glucose level of the bodys fluids. The data is transmitted to a receiver, and patients can see a constant reading of their blood sugar levels. Some sensors transmit data directly to an insulin pump, so you can use the reading to adjust and finetune the amount of insulin being pumped into the body."
"CGM technology is a step toward the ultimate goal of controlling type I diabetes using whats called a closed loop system. The current systems are open looped, meaning the diabetic controls when the doses are given. The goal is to eventually create a pump that is more like a robotic delivery system, and all the patient has to do is wear it. The patient still has to test his or her blood sugar to confirm the sensor is properly calibrated."
"Once that technology is perfected, this type of device would be implanted, which would be the next best thing to not having diabetes. Forty years ago, before the advent of all of the cool diabetes technology such as insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitors and blood sugar testing, parents were given a fairly grim prediction for how their child would fare."
"I spoke with Dr. Deputy, who recently retired from his pediatric practice, and he seemed to remember me. When I asked him about his dismal prognosis for my survival, he said sadly, At that time, that was what we told parents back then. I think he was relieved that his prognosis was wrong. I know that I certainly am. In fact, I am hoping to live another"
"Former Wales and British Lions center Ray Gravell has died of a suspected heart attack aged 56. Gravell won 23 caps for Wales and played on the Lions tour of South Africa in 1980. He made his debut for Wales against France in 1975, three years after helping his club side Llanelli to their famous win over the touring All Blacks."
"Gravell made 23 appearances for what was then a dominant Wales side. He won Grand Slams in 1976 and 1978, and played all four Tests on the Lions tour of South Africa in 1980. After retiring as a player in 1985, Gravell became president of Llanelli RFC. He also pursued a career as an actor and a respected rugby broadcaster."
"Obama was a wonderful ambassador for rugby and for Wales. He was a great example of how the game can bring out the best in a man. As a player, he always gave a huge amount of respect to his opponents. It is a measure of the man that he forged rugby friendships which lasted long after his playing days up until the present day."
"The concerts were meant to boost black voters support for his presidential nominee bid. The ensuing controversy highlighted that Obamas desire to unite disparate voting blocs especially religious voters under his umbrella of change is not without some serious pitfalls. The Grammyaward winning singer is on record as saying homosexuality is a choice, and that he was once involved with those desires."
"John Aravosis, a prominent gay blogger and cofounder of the Web site AmericaBlog, led the charge against the Obama campaign. He wrote that the Illinois Democrat was sucking up to antigay bigots and giving them a stage. The campaign has vigorously promoted the candidates faith, launching 40 Days of Faith and Family in September, which used Bible study groups to tap into the black electorate."
"Campaigners have run three radio ads, one of which called Obama a Christian family man. Earlier this month, Obama spoke at an evangelical church in the traditionally conservative city of Greenville. After that appearance, the Obama campaign told CNN that Republicans no longer had a choke hold on issues of faith and values. I think that what youre seeing is a breaking down of the sharp divisions that existed maybe during the90s, Obama said."
"Obama issued a statement saying, I strongly disagree with Reverend Donnie McClurkin's views. A September poll of African Americans in South Carolina by Winthrop University and ETV showed that 62 percent of those surveyed said that sex between two adults of the same sex is strongly unacceptable. Obama announced that the Rev. Andy Sidden, an openly gay South Carolina pastor, will appear at the same event on Sunday."
"Solomonese spoke with Senator Barack Obama today and expressed to him our communitys disappointment for his decision to continue to remain associated with Reverend McClurkin. There is no gospel in Donnie McClurkins message for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people and their allies. Thats a message that certainly doesnt belong on any presidential candidates stage."
"After the call, the South Carolina Gay and Lesbian Pride Movement announced it will hold a protest vigil outside Sundays concert in Columbia. Privately, Obama aides say they believe Obama is a candidate of real, transformational change. In South Carolina, where African Americans make up about half of Democratic primarygoers, voters might not have a problem with McClurkin at all."
Atletico Madrid beat Real Zaragoza 40 in the Primera Liga on Sunday. Luis Garcia scored his first goal for the club in a comfortable win. Maxi Rodriguez scored a double and Diego Forlan also netted for Atletico. Atletico moved up to sixth in the table after the win over European rivals Zaragozas.

"Getafe registered their first win of the season with a 20 victory over Murcia. Substitute Kepa, who was later sent off, opened the scoring in the 54th minute. Francisco Casero added a second five minutes later to clinch the points. Last seasons second division champions Valladolid continue to struggle in the top flight, crashing to a 21 defeat against Athletic Bilbao."
"The company owns The Venetian Resort Hotel Casino and the Sands Expo and Convention Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. It also owns the Sands Macau in The Peoples Republic of Chinas Special Administrative Region of Macau. The first phase of theVenetian Casino Resort opened in May 1999, which originally consisted of 3,036 suites though the number of suites was reduced over time to 3,014 based on renovations and remodeling. In 2003, the property added the 1,013suite Venezia tower  giving The Venets 4,027 suites, 18 worldclass restaurants, and a retail mall with canals, gondolas and singing gondoliers."
"The Sands Macau includes approximately 163,000 square feet of gaming facilities, luxury suites, specialty restaurants and an International VIP club. In December 2004, in one of the years most anticipated initial public offerings, Dr. and Mr. Adelson rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange. The price of the Sands stock rose 61 percent on its opening day, becoming the largest opening day of any Americanbased initial public offering in the last two years."
"Condoleezza Rice says people need to serve where they are needed. Rice was responding to foreign service officers objections to the possibility of directed assignments in Iraq. If the State Department enforces directed assignments, it will be the first time since the Vietnam War era."
"One official called the order to serve in Iraq a potential death sentence during the town meeting. The State Department already has begun notifying about 200 people considered prime candidates. Those chosen will be given 10 days to respond, according to last weeks announcement."
"Some at the hourlong meeting questioned why they were not told of the policy change directly. I just have no respect for the whole process because youve demonstrated a lack of respect for your own colleagues, one diplomat said."
"The secretary of state sent out a cable to State Department employees worldwide encouraging them to serve in Iraq. Others pointed out the risks of such assignments, considering the dangers of a war zone, lack of security and regular rocket attacks on U.S. personnel. Rice, who did not attend the meeting, tried to calm things down by underscoring the State Departments attempts to do everything that we can to try and protect our diplomats."
"Ambassador Ryan Crocker has identified the need for additional positions to more effectively accomplish our mission in Iraq. Rice said she has decided to go forward with the identification of officers to serve, should it prove necessary to direct assignments. If others step forward, as some already have, we will fill these new jobs as we have before  with volunteers."
"The assignments are new positions. Fifteen people have stepped forward to volunteer for Iraq service since the new policy was announced October 26. Rep. Duncan Hunter, RCalifornia, said wounded U.S. military veterans should be asked to fill the Iraq vacancies. Since 2003, more than 1,500 personnel have volunteered to go to Iraq."
"State Department employees have been killed in Iraq, but McCormack could not say how many. With the expansion of the staff in Iraq this year, 58 spots were left open. They are serving in dangerous and challenging places, he said."
"Bodies of four people believed to be illegal immigrants found in a canyon east of San Diego. Seven other deaths are labeled as firerelated. Three elderly people died during evacuations, and four others died after being evacuated. The number of deaths attributed directly to the fires grew to seven Thursday."
"Improving conditions allowed more people to come home Thursday. Where residents could return, they often found ash and rubble in place of their homes. The most important thing is that our family is still together, everybody is safe, and eventually we will rebuild again, said Louela Binlac."
"Rancho Bernardo resident Marilyn Wood said it was really scary to come back to the pile of ashes she once called home. Her voice breaking, Wood vowed to rebuild and recounted how she and her husband, Gordon, fled early Monday."
"Bush promises federal help for those affected by the fires. 10 still burning across seven counties. Were not going to forget you in Washington, D.C., the president said after touring the area by air."
"The cost of homes destroyed by the wildfires is likely to top 1 billion in San Diego County alone. People left homeless by the fires can apply online for federal help at FEMA.gov. Almost 9,000 firefighters battled the blazes, augmented by reinforcements from dozens of states."
"Twentythree fires have scorched 472,478 acres 738 square miles, an area roughly threequarters of the size of Rhode Island. Along with homes and businesses, the flames have destroyed roughly onethird of San Diego Countys lucrative avocado crop. A change in the winds from a ferocious 100 mph on Sunday to an almost manageable 10 mph on Thursday brought welcome relief."
"Residents of several communities were allowed to return home Wednesday and Thursday. The latest evacuations cover the communities of Lake Henshaw and Mesa Grande. With the shifting fires, some shelters closed as others opened closer to danger. Qualcomm Stadium, home of NFLs Chargers, will close to evacuees, San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders says. The fires still threatened some 25,000 homes, but the burn rate was significantly lower Thursday, a spokeswoman says. of the fires."
"The Orange County Sheriffs Department announced a 250,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the 23,000acre Santiago fire. Qualcomm will close as an emergency shelter at noon tomorrow Friday."
"The FBI and the ATF are assisting Orange County authorities with the investigation. In other arson investigations, two men have been arrested in San Bernardino County, one in San Fernando and an adult and a juvenile in San Diego County. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection considers the Rosa fire in Riverside County an arson case. That fire burned more than 400 acres before being fully contained."
The commander of the nuclearpowered submarine USS Hampton has been relieved of his command amid an inquiry into misconduct by crew members. None of the misconduct is believed to be connected with the major fires burning in the area.
Michael B. Portland lost his post due to a loss of confidence in his ability to command. William J. Houston will replace Portland. The crew neither maintained inspection records nor conducted the required inspection of chemical levels associated with the cooling system of the ships nuclear reactor.
Portlands demotion brings to 10 the number of people relieved of duty on the submarine in the wake of the misconduct probe. Six personnel have been punished for forging inspection records for the cooling system. One officer and five enlisted personnel received a nonjudicial punishment after other Navy personnel discovered their actions.
"The misconduct was discovered September 17 but not made public until after completion of an initial inquiry. A factfinding investigation is under way, and further action against Navy crew members is possible. The Hampton remains in port in San Diego, California. In all, the 900 million vessels crew includes 13 officers and 116 enlisted personnel."
"Two passengers were found dead inside the bus, said Arkansas State Police. Forty people were hurt in Sunday nights crash, which shut down a 13mile stretch of Interstate40 east of Forrest City, Arkansas. The bus was westbound en route from Chicago, Illinois, to Dallas, Texas. The driver of the pickup truck identified as 30yearold Danny Okurily of Hot Springs, Arkansas, died at the scene of the accident."
"Two passengers were also found dead inside the bus, police say. The bus, which listed 44 passengers on its manifest, was owned and operated by the Tornado Bus Line. Several dozen injured passengers were taken to hospitals in Forrest City, Memphis and West Memphis, police said."
"Three years ago, Kelly Pless weighed 220 pounds at her heaviest. She lost 95 pounds through diet and exercise. Pless now weighs 145 pounds and is 5-foot-3."
"The 31-year-old graduate student from Sunny Isles Beach, Florida, has struggled with her weight. She started gaining as a teenager and by the time she graduated from high school, she was carrying 215 pounds on her 5 2 frame. Prom, she says, was a nightmare."
"After high school, she lost 50 pounds. But because she hadnt done it in a healthy way, her weight crept back up. At 28, she started having trouble breathing and doctors told her the weight was to blame."
"I remember feeling like even if I tried, it wasnt something my body was capable of. Despite her doubts, Pless decided to do something. Fortunately she didnt have to look far for inspiration. Her manager at the Kennedy Space Center ran marathons."
"Pless believed that if she just focused on eating less and moving more, everything would fall into place. At first, it was hard to start exercising because I was worried people would make fun of me. But then I just told myself, if thats the worst that could happen..."
"I just got out there and didnt care. Eventually, she started to run or shuffle as she jokingly recalls. She also adopted an eat to live philosophy and satisfied her cravings for sweets by eating lots of fruit."
"That was my weak spot. After a few months of cutting those things out, I focused more on portion control. Make sure Im not eating out of boredom or at social events, I try to make sure I'm not overeating, just because everyone else is."
"Pless pays close attention to societal pressure, which she believes is the reason many people overeat. Restaurant servings are about three times bigger than a normal portion size, she says. She makes sure she doesnt overeat when dining out simply because the food is there."
"Pless has lost 95 pounds and kept it off for 1½ years. As a result, she says, shes healthier and more confident. Pless: ""What do I really want to eat? Or, what does my body really want right now?"""
Shes also set a new professional goal  to pursue a doctorate in food and exercise psychology so she can help others who are battling obesity and eating disorders. The negative side to weight loss is that people treat people differently.
"Pless runs about 40 miles a week while she trains for two marathons she plans to run this winter. The first is in November in Las Vegas, Nevada, and the second is in Miami, Florida, in January. She said she cant imagine taking the break from running that recovering from surgery would require."
"The Singapore Airlineowned A380 completed its maiden passenger journey between Singapore and Sydney. It was two years late and billions of dollars over budget, but this week it made history with the first double bed on a commercial jet."
"On board were nearly 500 passengers who had bid thousands of dollars for the historical experience. Singapore Airlines CEO, Chew Choon Seng named the jetliner the queen of the skies. Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus said he would like to celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary on one of its double beds."
"The A380 is the quietest large passenger jet ever built inside and out. It can carry 40 percent more passengers than other large aircraft and in greater comfort. The wellheeled can luxuriate in a private cabin designed by leading French yacht designer, JeanJacques Coste. And CNNs Richard Quest, who was on board the maiden flight, said there was nothing quite like it."
Travelers can catch a movie on a 23inch widescreen LCD. Laptops can be plugged into an inseat power supply. Business travelers with just a thumb drive can access a suite of office tools on Singapore Airlines inflight entertainment system.
"Singapore Airlines has ordered 19 superjumbos for an estimated price tag of 5.7 billion. The first Boeing 747s soon ditched the lounges and bars on the upper decks in favor of seats that could generate cash. Behind the 12 luxury suites there are 399 economy seats, ranked 10abreast on upper and lower decks, as well as 60 business class seats that are the biggest yet at 87 centimeters wide."
"One passenger paid 100,000 for the experience, with the majority paying between 1,500 and 5,000. The 1.4 million raised has gone to charities in Singapore, Sydney and a global humanitarian organization. From Sunday 28 October, Singapore Airlines will commence its scheduled service between Singapore and Sydney."
"The jetliner will be used on one of the three daily flights between Singapore and Londons Heathrow Airport. The airline has a tough delivery schedule ahead to fulfil its 185 orders to 15 customers. Next year it plans to deliver 13, a further 25 in 2009 and 45 in 2010."
"Airports around the world have had to make changes to runways and gates, as well as buy in new vehicles that can tow the giant aircraft. Seventy airports are now ready, Airbus has said. Singapores Changi Airport, home to the Singapore Airlines A380 fleet, was the first, and when its new Terminal 3 opens early next year, 19 gates across the three terminals will be A380ready."
"Heathrow's new Terminal 5 will be able to handle four A380s at one time. British Airways, the Terminals sole occupant, recently confirmed an order for 12 superjumbos and it now wants BAA to upgrade a satellite building to be built next to Terminal 5 to accommodate them. As Willie Walsh, BAs CEO told CNN, we want to make sure that development is built with the A380 in mind."
"As Richard Quest says, theres no doubt the A380 will sell, but it is going to take a long time to reach the 420 sales which is the amount Airbus needs to make money. But those worries, he adds, are for another day. Thursday was a day for celebration. Total 185 orders 165 firm orders 15 customers."

"The U.S. will increase export restrictions on technologies that could pose a danger to national security. China and Iran pose particular export control concerns, the Justice Department says. Representatives of more than a half dozen federal agencies will jointly announce their plans. Officials plan to highlight two recent cases at a news conference Thursday."
"In the past week a Pittsburgh company, SparesGlobal Inc., was sentenced for lying about an illegal export. In Utah, two men were charged last week with attempting to illegally export restricted components for F4 and F14 fighter jets. F14 components are widely sought by Iran, which is the only military in the world that still flies the jet."
King Abdullah of Saudi Arabias visit to London this week caused a wave of dissent. UK political elite boycotted events. UK foreign secretary pulled out of a meeting with his Saudi counterpart. Saudi King accused British officials of ignoring information that could have averted the terror attacks in London on July 2005.
Saudi Arabia is the UKs largest trading partner in the Middle East. The UK is the second largest foreign investor in the Kingdom. UK Trade  Investment has designated Saudi Arabia one of its 17 High Growth Markets.
"Saudi Arabia is planning six privatelydeveloped economic cities. The 26.6 billion King Abdullah Economic City will create one million jobs. The aim, says the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority, is to boost the economy by creating a probusiness environment. The UK has, since the early 1990s, been one of the top five exporters to Saudi Arabia."
"In 2007, Saudi Arabian bank SABB predicts that UK exports to the Kingdom will increase by more than 5.5 per cent to reach 2.8 billion. In the 1980s, three quarters of Saudi exports to Britain were from oil, but today the nonoil sector accounts for 59 percent of exports."
"Products being shipped to the UK include machinery, transport equipment, plastics, nonmetallic minerals and, despite the UKs dominance in the sector, chemicals. There are also more than 150 SaudiBritish joint ventures underway with a value of around 15 billion. The biggest deal that will mark their relationship in trade is the purchase of 72 Eurofighter Typhoon Jets that was sealed last week."
This comes less than a year after the UK government decided to call off a Serious Fraud Office investigation into defense contracts with Saudi Arabia. This probe related to the sale of weapons by BAE Systems to Saudi Arabia in the 1980s. BAE has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and making payments to Saudi royals to win business.
"Tens of thousands of Congolese refugees fled camps Tuesday in the Democratic Republic of Congo as rebel troops attacked government forces in the area. U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it didnt appear rebels had targeted the camps, but it reported some were looted after camp residents, classified as internally displaced persons, fled."
"Roads to Goma, about 10 miles from the camps, were crowded with refugees and local residents fleeing the fighting. Torrential rain made the movement even more difficult. Internally displaced people are moving from site to site, direction Goma."
"The Congolese government accused troops under rebel general Laurent Nkunda of staging the attack. A NKunda spokesman denied the allegation, according to a report from the Integrated Regional Information Networks. The spokesman, Bwambale Kakolele, said Rwandan Hutu rebels who also operate in the area were behind the attack, that report said. Now they have nothing but what they can carry."
"A spokesman for the U.N. military mission in the Congo said it was uncertain which group attacked the Congo army outpost. The UNHCR said 375,000 Congolese in North Kivu province have been forced from their homes in the past year. In the past two months alone, 160,000 have fled their homes amid the fighting between renegade troops and government forces, the agency said. It said about 28,000 had abandoned the first three camps."
"Genarlow Wilson served two years of a 10-year sentence for aggravated child molestation. 21-year-old says prospect of being labeled a sex offender drove him to turn down the deal. North Kivu is in eastern Congo near the borders of Rwanda and Uganda. Congolese President Joseph Kabila has tried to gain a ceasefire with the rebels in the area under Nkunda, but fighting continues."
"He had to think about his 9yearold sister and having a family of his own one day, he says. ""I wouldnt be able to stay with my mother because I have a little sister. You know, when youre a sex offender you cant be around kids"""
"In 2005, a jury found Wilson guilty of aggravated child molestation for having oral sex with a 15yearold girl. The conviction carried a 10year mandatory prison sentence and a sex offender designation. Prosecutors in Douglas County, Georgia, offered Wilson a plea deal that would have reduced his sentence."
"The state Legislature last year amended the law under which Wilson was convicted, making such sexual encounters misdemeanors. However, the Legislature did not make the law retroactive, so it had no effect on Wilsons sentence. Now 21, Wilson was released Friday after the state Supreme Court ruled 43 that the young mans sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment."
"The new Genarlow Wilson will be more conservative, more alert and more appreciative of the blessings bestowed upon him. He wants to major in sociology, he said, because I feel like Ive been living my major. I know what it feels like to be without and I dont want to ever feel like that again, he says."
"Though he called his sentence absurd, Wilson said he understands that prosecutors were doing their job and they felt they were carrying out the law. Wilson also said he knows what he did was foolish. I did some idiotic things in my teen years, but you know, every average teen does, he said. I dont think any of us made very wise decisions."
"Dianne Feinstein and Charles Schumer announced they would support the retired federal judge from New York. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee announced his opposition to the nominee. If all the Republican members of the committee also vote for Mukasey, which is expected, his nomination will go before the full Senate. A leading Democrat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday that the nomination is likely to be confirmed."
"Gonzales gave up the post in September. This is an extremely difficult decision, Schumer said. When an administration so political, so out of touch with the realities of governing and so contemptuous of the rule of law is in charge, we are never left with an ideal choice."
"A number of Democratic senators, however, have said they will oppose Mukasey because of questions about his views on the interrogation technique called waterboarding. Waterboarding involves restraining a suspect and using water to produce the sensation of drowning. While saying serious questions have been raised about Mukaseys views on torture and on separation of powers, Feinstein said she would support the nominee because the Justice Department needed fresh leadership."
"Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy, DVermont, announced he would vote against the Mukasey nomination. No American should need a classified briefing to determine whether waterboarding is torture, Leahy said. Watch Sen. Leahy explain why he cant support the Mukasesy nomination on CNN at 10 p.m. ET."
"Waterboarding was used at least as long ago as the Spanish Inquisition. We prosecuted Japanese war criminals for waterboarding after World War II. America needs to be certain and confident of the bedrock principle that no one, not even the president, is above the law."
"President Bush has equated asking Mukasey about his opinion of waterboarding with asking him about the CIArun interrogation program, whose details are classified. Bush said the program does not violate U.S. bans on torture, but added that MukaseY does not want an uninformed opinion to be taken by our professional interrogators in the field as placing them in legal jeopardy."
Sources say waterboarding was used in the interrogation of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. He is now facing trial before a military tribunal for planning al Qaedas 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. Sources with knowledge of the CIArun interrogation program have said agents are no longer using waterboarding.
"The practice was used by the Spanish Inquisition, Cambodias Khmer Rouge and the World War II Japanese military. It is specifically banned in U.S. law governing the treatment of prisoners by the military. Nine people were killed and 19 injured after a tour bus left a highway and rolled over Sunday night."
"At least 50 people were on the Arrow Stage Lines bus when it crashed. The bus was traveling from Telluride, Colorado, to Phoenix, Arizona. It left the right side of the highway and rolled over, Trooper Cameron Roden says."
"Police said the bus lost control on a curve, ran off the road and rolled over several times. The roof of the bus split open and multiple occupants of the vehicle were ejected. Rescue crews took the injured people to hospitals in Utah, Colorado and Arizona. The Salt Lake Tribune reported that ambulances from Utah,. Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico responded to the accident."
"Four of the dead were male and five were female, the Utah Highway Patrol says. Most of the passengers were returning home from a weekend ski trip to Telluride."
Banksy has been spray painting his stencils around Britain and further afield for over ten years. Last week ten of his original pieces were sold at Bonhams auction house in London for over 1 million. Tower Hamlets council authority has pledged to remove his graffiti from its streets. The artist's art sells for hundreds of thousands of dollars but he continues to use public spaces as his main canvas.
"Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie bought three of his prints in 2006. Fans include Hollywood Alisters, including Christina Aguilera. The recent sales of his work put him on a par with JeanMichel Basquiat as the bestselling street artist. He set out to lampoon the establishment, he has now been wholeheartedly embraced by it. His work is now sold now by major art galleries."
"Banksy is feted by art dealers and artists, including Damien Hirst. He regularly mocks the art world that is so enthralled by him. Despite the huge popularity and exposure of his work, Banksys identity remains a mystery. It took the British Museum eight days to discover the prehistoric rock painting of a man with a shopping trolley."
"Banksy is originally from Bristol, is around 30 years old and called Robert or Robin Banks, but its been reported that even his parents are thought to believe that he makes his living as a painter and decorator. He continues to divide opinion as to whether his work is vandalism or public art. Bristol city council has recognized the popularity and artistic merit of his work by protecting a number of pieces around the city."
Tower Hamlets and Hackney councils in London have pledged to remove his graffiti from their streets. But this latest piece may also have revealed what the artist actually looks like. A passerby took a photo of what is thought to be the artist at work.
"A spokesperson for Banksy refused to confirm it was him, but did say it was definitely his work. Naples has had problems in finding sites for municipal dumps now workers have stopped collecting trash. There is a popular saying here that roughly goes like this everybody is competent enough to find a solution but nobody is responsible for actually carrying it out."
"Naples dumps reached full capacity more than a decade ago. Since then a state of emergency has been declared every year. Eight different commissioners have been appointed, but they have all failed to solve the problem. The problem is as old and ugly as rotten trash."
State of emergency means government money 1.8 billion more than 2.5 billion in emergency funds have been devolved to deal with the problem. It is still difficult to find out where or how that money has been spent. One Italian newspaper suggested that a good 20 of the money went to pay for the salaries of those in charge of coming up with a solution.
"The Naples prosecutor in charge of environmental crimes says city government officials use the state of emergency to quickly award contracts. Once they receive the money, companies linked to the underworld dispose of the waste either in the open or, ironically, at regular city dumps. The mafia clans have now managed to burrow their way so deeply into the system that every attempt to fix the problem has proved futile."
"The government wants to reopen a previously shut dump to dispose of 3,700 tons of waste which is laying in the streets of Naples and surrounding areas. The problem is that when the site was closed years ago, locals were promised that a golf course would be built there."
"Russian President Vladimir Putin says security threats have forced Russia to revive bomber flights. Putin said 14 strategic bombers had taken off simultaneously from airfields across Russia in the early hours of Friday on longrange missions. ""We have decided to restore flights by Russian strategic aviation on a permanent basis,"" Putin told reporters after inspecting joint military exercises with China and four Central Asian states in Russias Ural mountains."
White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said he did not believe the flights posed a threat to the United States. The sorties are likely to add to Western concern about Russias growing assertiveness. That trend has prompted some U.S. policymakers to draw parallels with the Cold War.
"Putin caused a stir this year by saying Russian missiles would once again be aimed at targets in Europe if Washington persisted with plans to build a missile defense shield in eastern Europe. Russian diplomats have clashed with the United States and European governments on issues such as Kosovo, energy, and Moscows treatment of its exSoviet neighbors."
"Flights by other countries strategic aircraft continue, Putin says. That appeared to be a swipe at the U.S. and NATO, whose strategic bombers have continued to fly longrange missions. Four Russian military helicopters appeared and hovered in the background while Russian tanks trundled behind him. During the Cold War, Russian longrange bombers played elaborate games of catandmouse with Western air forces."
"The Pentagon said the Russian aircraft had not come close enough to U.S. ships to prompt American aircraft to react. In July, two Russian Tu95 Bear bombers made unusually long sorties over the North Sea, leading Norway and Britain to scramble fighter jets to follow them."
"A businessman asked Louis Lassen for something quick that he could eat on the run in 1900. He cooked up a beef patty, put it between some bread, and sent the man on his way. Pretty modest beginnings for arguably the most popular sandwich of alltime. The burger did not come from Louis so ketchup is OK."
"If you visit Louis today, youll find that not much has changed. The Lassen family still owns and operates the restaurant. The burgers are still cooked in ancient gas stoves. Just like then, there is absolutely no ketchup allowed."
"ChipShop owner Christopher Sell had the brilliant idea to freeze the snack, dip it in batter, and deepfry it. Even The New York Times raved about how something magical happens when you taste the deepfried Twinkies. Sell, who was trained in classical French cuisine, didnt start with the Twinkie, though. In his native England, he fried up everything from MMs to Mars bars."
"In August of 1893, a failed goldminerturnedsodacompanyowner named Frank J. Wisner was drinking a bottle of his Myers Avenue Red root beer while looking up at Cow Mountain. Just then, a full moon illuminated the snowcap on the otherwise black mountain, and Wisner had a brilliant idea. The new drink was christened the black cow and became an instant classic."
"Cozy Dog Drive In opened alongside old Route 66 in Springfield, Illinois in 1946. Ed Waldmire, Jr. wanted to call his creation the Crusty Cur, but his wife convinced him to change the name to Cozy Dog. Cozy Dogs Drive In has been serving up corn dogs ever since."
"Gennaro Lombardi opened up a small grocery store in New York Citys Little Italy. In 1905, the establishment was licensed as a pizzeria, and its stayed that way ever since. The original restaurant closed in 1984 but reopened down the street 10 years later. The Pizzeria  Lombardis is located in the Little Italy neighborhood of New York."
"On its 100th anniversary in 2005, Lombardis decided to offer its pizza for the same price itd been sold for in 1905  5 cents a pie. Since 1979, Rutgers University has played host to a collection of mobile food vans collectively known as the Grease Trucks."
"Originally, they served a sandwich called the Fat Cat, which contained two cheeseburger patties. A hungry and broke student named Darrell W. Butler convinced one of the vendors to put chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, French fries, and marinara sauce on a sandwich. The concoction sounded so appetizing that the next 10 people in line ordered it."
"Pats King of Steaks is where the Philly cheesesteak was born. A cab driver who ate at Pats daily insisted on trying the new sandwich. With the first bite declared, Hey, forgetbout those hot dogs, you should sell these! Cab drivers know fast food about as well as anyone, so the brothers did just what the cabbie suggested."
"In no time, the modest stand turned into the Pats that exists today. Controversy remains, however, over whos responsible for putting the cheese in cheesesteak. Pats claims it was the first to do so in 1951, but acrossthestreet rival Joe Vento of Genos Steaks opened 1966."
"Pig Stand was one of the first restaurants to advertise using neon signs. A Kentucky favorite, derby pie is a chocolate and pecan tart with a pastrydough crust. The company also lays claim to opening Americas first drivein and inventing Texas toast."
"Melrose Inn manager George Kern created derby pie in the mid1950s with help from his parents, Walter and Leaudra. Mrs. Kern, being the crafty monopolist she was, copyrighted the name, and to this day, you can only get real DerbyPie through Kerns Kitchen, Inc. Not only that, a man from New England once handed Leauda a blank check for the recipe so that his daughter could make the pie at home. She refused."
"The terror plot was unraveled after a weekend raid outside Baku that netted several suspected members of the radical group. Britain also shut its embassy in Baku to the public on Monday following security concerns nearby. The Bibi Heybat Mosque, just outside the capital Baku, was the target of the plot, U.S. and Azerbaijans officials said."
"U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack stressed that the details are still unfolding. Several days ago, an Azerbaijani army officer who had connections to a radical Islamic group seized four assault rifles, a machine gun and 20 hand grenades. Government security forces tracked down the group and arrested several members during a sweep on Saturday. One suspected member of the militant group resisted arrest and was killed in the sweep, the spokesman said. officials."
"Several others are still at large, he added. The U.S. Embassy in Baku issued a warden message warning Americans in Azerbaijan to take precautions. Azerbaijan is a former Soviet republic that borders the Caspian Sea, and lies just north of Iran."
"McCormack said U.S. authorities are working closely with their counterparts in Baku. He said he expects the embassy to limit its operations on Tuesday, as well. The crew members of a North Korean freighter regained control of their ship from pirates. The USS James E. Williams ordered pirates to give up their weapons, the Navy says."
"Two pirates were killed and five were captured, the Navy said. The captured pirates were being held aboard the North Korean vessel. The bandits had seized the ships bridge, while the crew kept control of the steering gear and engines. Three wounded crew members were being treated aboard the guidedmissile destroyer USS James E. Williams."
"When the crew members stormed the bridge, the deadly battle began. After the crew regained control, Navy sailors boarded the Dai Hong Dan to help with the injured. North Korea and the United States have no diplomatic relations."
A second U.S. Navy destroyer is searching waters off Somalia for pirates. Gunmen aboard two skiffs hijacked the Panamanianflagged Golden Nori over the weekend. The guidedmissile destroyer USS Arleigh Burke has been pursuing the pirates. It entered Somali waters with the permission of the troubled transitional government in Mogadishu.
"Two military officials familiar with the details confirmed the ongoing operation. When the shots were fired, it was not known the ship was filled with highly flammable benzene. U.S. military officials indicate there is a great deal of concern about the cargo because it is so sensitive."
"Benzene is used as a solvent and to make plastics and synthetic fabrics. Four other ships in the region remain in pirate hands, the Navy says. U.S. and NATO warships have been patrolling off the Horn of Africa for years in an effort to crack down on piracy. The head of the transitional government resigned as his administration battled insurgents from the Islamic movement."
"Hospital officials reported 30 dead in three days of clashes on the citys south side. In June, the ship USS Carter Hall fired warning shots in an attempt to stop a hijacked Danish cargo ship off Somalia. In May, a U.S. Navy advisory warned merchant ships to stay at least 200 miles off the Somali coast."
"The pirates often are armed with automatic rifles and shoulderfired rockets. Vessels that increase speed and take evasive maneuvers avoid boarding. Those that slow down are boarded, taken to the Somali coastline and released after successful ransom payment. The agency issued a new warning to sailors in the Gulf of Aden, between Somalia and Yemen, after Sunday's hijacking. The pirates are often after protracted negotiations of as much as 11 weeks."
"Debra Lafave was arrested after talking with a teenager. She is not allowed to have contact with anyone under 18. But the judge did not send Lafave to jail, saying the violation was not willful and substantial."
"Lafave pleaded guilty in November 2005 to having sex with a 14-year-old boy. She was sentenced to three years under house arrest and seven years of probation. A tracking device she carries as part of her probation went off in court, prompting the prosecutor to observe, I think shes accounted for."
Lafave acknowledged she was aware that hugs and other forms of physical contact as well as conversations about sex with minors violated terms of her probation. She referred to the sexually explicit conversations at work as just girl talk.
"Lafave said she hugged the 17-year-old because it was a small restaurant with a casual atmosphere where coworkers felt like family. She received a verbal reprimand a year ago, according to testimony. The contacts that led to Thursdays probation violation hearing first surfaced during two polygraph tests administered as part of Lafaves courtordered supervision."
"When the behavior continued, her probation officer asked a judge to find her in violation. She was ordered to quit the restaurant job and now works as a receptionist in her mothers beauty shop. In the past, Lafave has said she suffers from bipolar disorder and is receiving treatment."
"Ralph Lauren has had a greater impact on the way American men and women dress than any other designer. The former tie salesman from the Bronx has his eye on China and Japan. He has also signed a deal to develop boutique spa hotels around the globe in former monasteries. Because, in the end, hes Ralph Lauren, and were not."
"Those ties were handmade, by the way, recalls Lauren. Back then, ties, even designer ones, didnt sell for more than 5 apiece. Mine were 12 to 15. Such luxury in something so simple was revolutionary."
"Lauren caught something that was in the air before any of his competitors had a chance to grab it. Lauren made it look as easy as Fred Astaire dancing down a staircase. What matters the most to me are clothes that are consistent and accessible, says the designer. It's the desire, not just to be a success but to look like one before youd even achieved your goal."
"When I look at the people Ive admired over the years, the ultimate stars, like Frank Sinatra, Cary Grant and Astaire, the ones who last the longest are the ones whose style has a consistency, whose naturalness is part of their excitement. Fashion is about establishing an image that consumers can adapt to their own individuality."
"The spotlight is always going to search for the newcomer, Lauren admits. But the key to longevity is to keep doing what you do better than anyone else. Its about getting your message out to the consumer."
"Lauren says she relies on people walking into her store saying,I want your clothes. Her clothes  the clothes we make for the runway arent concepts, she says. Thankfully, we have lots of them, says Lauren."
"Laurens effortless luxury is all over the red carpet, on ski slopes and boats, at Wimbledon and elsewhere. But far from giving his customary overthehead wave and riding off into his Coloradoranch sunset, the designer is going even more global."
"Lauren has stores in Milan, London, Paris and Moscow. More stores planned for China, Japan... oh, everywhere. There arent enough Americans out there, he says. Who better to start with than Ralph? Just as long as he doesnt let on that most of us still cant play a lick of polo."
"Suspect in fatal shooting of Philadelphia police officer captured in Miami, Florida. John Lewis, 6 feet, 270 pounds, was easy to spot as he was so tall, police say. Officers went to a homeless shelter where they found Lewis, who was pretty easy to spotted as hes 6 feet,. 270 pounds. He had taken a Miamibound bus from Philadelphia."
"He was apprehended unarmed and without incident, the Miami chief said. Miami Police Officer Gil Gonzalez said Lewis had a Bible and was praying when we went to get him. Philadelphia Mayor John F. Street said people at the shelter recognized Lewis from televised photos."
Lewis is suspected in the October 31 shooting of Philadelphia Police Officer Chuck Cassidy. Cassidy was shot in the head when he inadvertently walked into a robbery in progress at a Dunkin Donuts. Investigators said Lewis was spotted on security video boarding a bus to Miami on Saturday night.
"Mariano Santiago was shot in the shoulder late last Tuesday as he approached a vehicle. Officer Sandra VanHinkle was shot early last Sunday and is out of the hospital and doing well, police say."
"Lewis had been arrested in 2005 on drug charges, which were withdrawn after he completed a treatment program. He was arrested again in June on drugs charges, and that case is still pending, the AP reported."
"Tiburon means shark in Spanish, and its not hard to see how Hyundais sporty coupe can stalk the unwary firsttime buyer and snare them quickly. To break from the boring econobox, here are some of the more sculpted and stylish cars available for about 20,000 that will hold their looks for a long time."
"Tiburon in its third incarnation is perhaps the purest lowslung sportster that wont bust a firsttime buyers wallet. The startling Hyundaidesigned looks boast a touch of Italian styling uncommon for its bracket. The MazdaSpeed3 will storm from standing to a mile a minute in under six seconds and is said to hit 155 mph. This one isnt overbearingly dripped in trim or wings, but dont let any youngster tell you it doesnt have what it takes to make their peers jealous."
"Its secret is torque negation in the low gears and perhaps its 263 horses under the hood. Another hidden gem is its sevenspeaker Bose stereo. Much like the fantastic Chevy Cobalt SS, its younger sister Pontiac G5 GT boasts highly sprung motoring at a price that appeals to the firsttime buyers wallet."
"A new grille entirely, like a Phantom, may just be what you need to set it off against the crowd. The GTs inlinefour 2.4liter 173hp engine  drives the front wheels to hit 060 mph in 7.5 seconds. Gas mileage is good and customer satisfaction ratings are off the hook."
"The Civic hatch was my second car after a very shortlived VW Rabbit. The coupe tested earlier this year brought back fond memories of the Civics surprisingly roomy front cabin. Standard features include a 350watt premium sound system, a touchscreen satellitenavigation system whose screen flips to reveal the CD player, and a slot for a computer memory card."
The secondgeneration Scion FJ Cruiser is a hipster take on the Toyota FJ. Features include a central console that fits in a DVD player alongside a backlit GPS satnav system that lights up in any one of 10 colors. This one turns heads while allowing you to pack five adults in relative comfort. Its also got a funky dash that spectrally lights at night  what fun.
"Energetic, filled with flair and boasting a vertical fold the length of its bonnet. You dont get a third row of seats in there but, with the back row folded flat, it almost lends you to believe it can become a camper. Other great touches include an mp3 input jack and reclining rearseat headrests."
"President Bush blasts Congress for having worst record in 20 years. Congress is not getting its work done, Bush says. Bush criticized Congress for not being able to send a single appropriations bill to him. They havent seen a bill they could not solve without shoving a tax hike into it, he said."
"President Bush said the Senate was wasting valuable time by taking up the childrens health insurance bill, which he had earlier vetoed. Rep. Rahm Emanuel, DIllinois, issued a statement saying, congressional Republicans remain ready and willing to rubberstamp the Bush agenda. No to children's health care no to a new direction in Iraq and no to investing in Americas future."
"House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer calls Bush the biggest obstacle to extending health coverage to 10 million lowincome, workingclass American children. The State Childrens Health Insurance Program measure passed in the House last week would expand the program by nearly 35 billion over five years. Bush had proposed adding 5 billion to the program, and said the version he vetoed would have encouraged families to leave the private insurance market."
"Democratic leaders said the new version addresses Republican objections by tightening restrictions on illegal immigrants receiving SCHIP benefits. The program currently covers about 6 million children whose parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for the poor. Democrats want to extend the program to another 4 million, paying for it with a 61centperpack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes."
"The Senate could vote on the bill as early as Tuesday. There are now reports that Congressional leaders may be considering combining the Veterans and Department of Defense appropriations bills. Congress should pass each bill one at a time in a fiscally responsible manner, he said."
Bush also urged Congress to send him a clean defense appropriations bill and a war supplemental bill. Hoyers release said Bushs comments on appropriations bills and fiscal responsibility ring hollow. Bush also criticized Congress for trying to hold hostage funding for troops.
"The fight over 2008 appropriations bills is not a fight over spending, Malvo says. Democrats are the party of fiscal responsibility today, he says. Malvo: This administration has pursued the most fiscally irresponsible policies in American history. He says he is still grappling with shame, guilt, remorse and my own healing."
"Malvo, 22, spends 23 hours a day inside his cell at Virginias toughest prison. Social worker who has worked extensively with him said he draws selfportraits that often show him with a tear running down his cheek."
"Malvo and John Allen Muhammad terrorized the Washington area five years ago this month. Malvo's greatest fear is that another parental figure would abandon him, social worker Carmeta AlbarusLindo says. She says Muhammad became the teenagers surrogate father, convincing him that violence was the only way to correct perceived injustices to AfricanAmericans. He ordered Malvo to go to bed each night and to memorize passages from The Art of War, an ancient Chinese text on battlefield strategy."
"According to AlbarusLindo, Malvo was brainwashed into aiding Muhammad in the murders. However, prosecutors have said Malvo, even at 17, knew what he was doing. And when a Virginia jury spared Malvos life, some investigators said they were horrified."
"Some of the victims families said they are content that Malvo did not receive the death penalty. Vicki Buchanan Snyder, whose brother James Sonny Buchanan was shot in the back while mowing a patch of lawn, said she was satisfied with the verdict. As for Malvo, AlbarusLindo said he will never forgive himself for what has happened."
"When she first began seeing him, he still called Muhammad Dad. It took months, she said, before he stopped. In the interim, AlbarusLindo said, he took college correspondence courses and began to draw. Muhammad is at a Virginia prison called Sussex One."
"Muhammads ex-wife, Mildred, said she believed that she was the real target of the snipers. She runs a Web site called Afterthetrauma.org, devoted to the victims of domestic abuse. He wants to correct, he said, some inaccurate statements made by the news media."
"Mildred Muhammad said she feels her exhusband wanted to kill her as revenge. She said she too is convinced that John Allen Muhammad brainwashed the younger man. That boy was a victim before he even knew it, she said. His life was over when he said,Hi."
"Lucarelli keeps his place in the Italian squad after scoring twice against South Africa. Donadoni has again left out veteran forwards Filippo Inzaghi and Alessandro Del Piero. Juventus striker and Italy under21 international Raffaele Palladino gets his first callup.

Eric Prince is the chairman and CEO of the Prince Group and Blackwater USA. Blackwater provides an opportunity for military and law enforcement veterans with a record of honorable service to continue their support to the United States. Prince: Words alone cannot express the respect I have for these brave men and women who defend  who volunteer to defend U.S. personnel facilities and diplomatic missions.
"I am proud to be there to represent them today. After almost five years in active service as a U.S. Navy SEAL, I founded Blackwater in 1997. Ten years later, Blackwater trains approximately 500 members of the United States military and law enforcement agencies every day."
We are extremely proud of answering that call in supporting our country. Blackwater personnel supporting our overseas missions are all military and law enforcement veterans. No individual ever protected by Blackwater has ever been killed or seriously injured.
Numerous others have been wounded and permanently maimed. Blackwater personnel are subject to regular attacks by terrorists and other nefarious forces within Iraq. Our thoughts and our prayers are with their families.
"Any incident where Americans are attacked serves as a reminder of the hostile environment in which our professionals work to keep American officials and dignitaries safe. In doing so, more American service members are available to fight the enemy. Blackwater shares the committees interest in ensuring the accountability and oversight of contract personnel supporting U.S. operations."
"Blackwater looks forward to working with Congress and the executive branch to ensure that any necessary improvements to these laws and policies are implemented. The worldwide personnel protection services contract, which has been provided to this committee, was competitively awarded and details almost every aspect of operation and contract performance. In Iraq, Blackwater reports to the embassys regional security officer, or RSO. In conjunction with internal company procedures and controls, the RSO ensures that Blackwater complies with all relevant contractual terms and conditions."
"We have approximately 1,000 professionals serving today in Iraq as part of our nations total force. Blackwater does not engage in offensive or military missions but performs only defensive security functions. We at Blackwater welcome the FBI review announced yesterday, and we will cooperate fully."
"A recent report from the Department of State stated that in 2007 Blackwater conducted 1,873 security details for diplomatic visits to the red zone, areas outside the Green Zone in Iraq. Weapons were discharged in less than 1 percent of those missions, the report said. ""To the extent there is any loss of innocent life, ever, let me be clear that I consider that tragic,"" he said."
Benfica midfielder Augustin Binya sent off for tackle on Celtic's Scott Brown. Cameroon international was sent off in Benfica's 10-1 defeat in Glasgow. UEFA have punished the midfielder with a six-match European ban. Click here for more UEFA news.
"Benfica midfielder Binya banned for two years for tackle on Brown. Referee Martin Hansson described the challenge as one of the worst he had ever seen. Binyas challenge seriously endangered the physical health of the opposing player, according to uefa.com. Benfica can appeal against the ban, which rules the 24-year-old out of their remaining Group D matches against AC Milan and Shakhtar Donetsk."
"If unsuccessful, Brown will also miss any matches in the knockout stages of the Champions League or UEFA Cup. It is the second time that UEFA has had to intervene following an incident involving Celtic this season. AC Milan keeper Dida was handed a twomatch ban, subsequently reduced to one on appeal, after collapsing theatrically when a fan of the Scottish club invaded the pitch and lightly slapped the Brazilian in the face."
"Sen. Hillary Clinton remains the person to beat, a CNNOpinion Research Corporation poll released Monday suggests. The New York Democrat continues to dominate the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. But Clintons path to the White House is in no way certain. Clinton was criticized for her performance during a debate last week, and her rivals have stepped up attacks that she has equivocated on Iraq, Iran and other major issues."
The Republican presidential candidates have also stepped up their attacks on the Democratic frontrunner. Each suggests that he has the best chance of stopping Clinton. The attacks may be working. The CNNOpinion Research polls suggests that Clintons support has slipped from its height one month ago.
"Clinton is the top choice of 44 percent of the likely Democratic voters interviewed for the poll. Her closest rival, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois, was the top choices of 25 percent. All other Democratic candidates were in single digits. The poll involved 467 interviews conducted on November 24 with Democrats or independents who lean Democratic."
"The polls margin of error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. In an October CNNOpinion Research poll, Clinton was supported by 51 percent of Democratic voters and had a 30 point lead over Obama. Clinton received heavy criticism from her fellow Democratic presidential rivals."
"The American people deserve a president of the United States that they know will tell them the truth, Edwards said. Edwards has also accused Clinton of being a corporate Democrat too willing to defend a corrupt Washington establishement. In the Republican presidential race, Giuliani continues to be the leading candidate, with the backing of 28 percent of the Republican primary voters polled."
Former Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee was backed by 19 percent. Sen. John McCain of Arizona was the top pick of 16 percent. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney had 11 percent.
"In a headtohead matchup of the two frontrunners, Clinton leads Giuliani 51 percent to 45 percent. That lead has increased since October, when Clinton led Giuliani 49 percent to 47 percent. The poll involved telephone interviews with 397 Republicans or independents who lean Republican."
"Only 42 percent of Americans think things are going well, while 58 percent think they are going badly. Americans are not just pessimistic about the country, they are also angry. More than eight in 10 say they are angry about the wayThings are going in the country. Clinton would get the support of 48 percent of voters, Giuliani 32 percent and the thirdparty candidate 18 percent."
"The polls margin of error was plusorminus 3 percent. The lack of enthusiasm for Giuliani, particularly by social conservatives, could spell trouble for the GOP next year if he becomes the nominee, Holland said."
"Vladimir Putin is in Tehran to attend a summit of Caspian Sea nations. Putin says he and the other leaders agreed that peaceful nuclear activities must be allowed in the region. Only 27 percent of Republicans say they would feel enthusiastic if Giuliani won the GOP nod, and the remaining GOP candidates fare even worse, Putin says. The Iranians are cooperating with Russian nuclear agencies and the main objectives are peaceful objectives, he says."
"Russia is building Irans first nuclear power plant and has resisted moves by the U.S. and its allies to impose stronger U.N. sanctions against Tehran. The leaders of Iran, Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan also met Tuesday to reach agreement on issues relating to the sharing and regulating of the Caspian Sea. Putin said that no Caspians nation should offer its territory to third parties intent on military action against other countries in the region, a reference to rumors that the United States planned to use Azerbaijan as a base for a possible attack against Iran."
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad says no Caspian nation should offer its territory to third powers for use of force or military aggression. Putin says rumors of an attempt on his life would not stop his plans. Putin was greeted by Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki as he stepped off his plane at Tehrans Mehrabad Airport. The Russian president was in Germany for talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
"Iranian officials deny there was an assassination plot against Putin. Foreign Ministry spokesman describes rumors of a possible terrorist action during the Putin visit as baseless. Spreading this kind of totally false news lacks any value and cannot damage the trend of the prepared programs, spokesman Mohammadali Hosseini said. Putins visit is the first by a leader in the Kremlin to Iran since Joseph Stalins World War II conference meeting with U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill."
"Putins trip to Tehran is a show of Russias independence in global affairs. Putin, who approaches the end of his term, wants to demonstrate that he wouldnt cave in to the U.S. pressure. Putins schedule also includes meetings with Ahmadinejad and Irans supreme leader, Ali Khamenei."
"Three French journalists charged in alleged plot to kidnap African children arrive in Paris. French President Nicolas Sarkozy held emergency talks in Chad. 14 other people remained in custody in the African nation. Some facing serious charges that could send them to jail for up to 20 years. The journalists were among seven Europeans a Chadian judge released Sunday, including a Spanish flight crew."
"Some of the children may never return to their families because it is too difficult to determine their backgrounds. Those who remain under arrest in Chad are six members of the French charity, four Chadians. Some face kidnapping and fraud charges. Zoes Ark leader Eric Breteau testified Saturday that the three journalists and the flight crew were not involved in the alleged plot."
"The three journalists initially had been charged with complicity in the alleged kidnapping attempt. Sarkozy expressed satisfaction that some of those detained had been released. At the same time, he told reporters, We should respect the sovereignty of Chad."
"Zapatero thanked Sarkozy for dropping the four Spanish flight crew members off in their home country. Sarkozy stressed the scandal would not affect the strong relations between the two countries. The charity says that the children were orphans from the Darfur region where the United Nations estimates 200,000 people have been killed in four years of conflict. But after preliminary interviews with the children, aid agencies say most of them probably are not orphans and not from Sudan, but instead come from villages on the Chadian side of the border."
"The children are staying in an Abeche orphanage while aid agencies and government officials try to find out where they came from. A father of three of the children allegedly kidnapped told a French newspaper he put his children into the charitys care. The Chadian man, who gave his name as Arbab, told Le Parisien on Sunday that workers from Zoes Ark had visited his village three times."
"Sixth U.S. service member dies from injuries sustained in helicopter crash. Black Hawk helicopter crashed in northeastern Italy on Thursday. Four people were killed and seven were injured in the crash, the military said. No one on the ground was hurt, fire officials said in Treviso, Italy, where the crash happened. Italy."
"The helicopter crashed in an open area near the Piave River north of Treviso. The military was not releasing the names of those killed, pending notification of the victims families. Italys ANSA news agency said the helicopter crashed near the bridge of a major highway."
The Black Hawk is considered the workhorse of the militarys helicopter fleet. It is used in missions in Iraq and Afghanistan to carry troops and equipment. The helicopters first combat mission was about 25 years ago.
"Taylor Bradford, 21, fatally wounded near campus residence hall area. He had apparently gotten into his car after being shot, and drove a short distance before crashing. Bradford  a 5foot11, 300pound defensive lineman from Nashville. He was pronounced dead at Regional Medical Center."
"DeeShawn Tate, Victor Trezevant, and Courtney Washington have been charged with murder in perpetration of attempted aggravated robbery. Police say Bradford was targeted because of some information that was out there and the fact that they believed he had some cash, or he had something that they wanted."
"The three suspects will make an initial court appearance as early as Tuesday. Prosecutors are considering seeking the death penalty in the case, but no decision has been made. None of the three arrested suspects were students at the university, the district attorney says."
"Court orders pop singer Britney Spears to give up custody of her children. Britney and Kevin Federline have two children. Bradford, a marketing major, was popular with the football team and on the campus. He had transferred from Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama."
"Spears former husband, Kevin Federline, is to retain custody of their two sons until further order of the court. Last month, a judge ordered Spears, 25, to submit to random drug tests after finding she engaged in habitual, frequent, and continuous use of controlled substances and alcohol."
"The former couple has been embroiled in a bitter custody fight over their sons, Sean Preston and Jayden. The parents had split custody 5050, but Federline asked for the arrangements to be shifted to 7030 in his favor. In addition to ordering the twiceweekly drug tests, Gordon ordered Spears to spend eight hours per week working with a parenting coach."
He also barred the exes from making derogatory remarks about the other party and the other partys family or significant other during the case. And he ordered the parents to go through joint coparenting counseling and barred them from using corporal punishment on the boys. Spears and Federline were married for two years before their divorce became final in July.
"Her former divorce lawyer, Laura Wasser, resigned last month as her legal representative after telling reporters the singer just wants to be a mom. Spears management company, the Firm, recently quit after representing the singer for little over a month."
"Eighth District Judge Jackie Glass hours earlier doubled Simpsons bail to ensure his appearance at an April 7 trial. Glass said Simpson had violated terms of his previous bail. Glass was adamant that Simpson remain in the Clark County Detention Center until 15 percent of the 250,000 is paid in full."
"The judge scolded Simpson, saying he wasnt taking the matter seriously. Simpson posted bail at about 615 p.m. local time."
"O.J. Simpson returned to jail in Nevada from his home in Florida January 11 for Wednesdays hearing. Prosecutors alleged he violated the terms of his bail by attempting to contact a codefendant. The original bail bondsman  Miguel Pereira of Floridabased You Ring, We Spring testified Wednesday that the former football player didnt put any money toward the bail that allowed him to leave jail in September."
"When questioned by Simpson attorney Yale Galanter, Pereira admitted he had never sent Simpson a bill for the premium. But, he said, he had an understanding with Simpson that he would be paid after it was all over. Glass described it as mindboggling that Simpson never had to put up any collateral for his first bond."
"Galanter did not contest the authenticity of the recording. As part of his bail granted September 19, Simpson was to have no contact whatsoever with victims, witnesses or codefendants in the case. When I tell you, Mr. Simpson, there are conditions and there are rules, let me make sure you understand if you violate those rules... youll be back, locked up in the Clark County Detention"
"I understand 100 percent, said Simpson, dressed in a navy blue jail jumpsuit. Simpson faces trial April 7 on 12 criminal counts, including conspiracy, kidnapping, robbery, burglary, coercion and assault with a deadly weapon. He will abide scrupulously by whatever this court decides, his attorney said."
"The Air Force is returning F15E Strike Eagle jets to service over Iraq and Afghanistan. The Air Force grounded models of its F15 fleet after the crash of an older model F15C this month. The charges stem from a September 13 incident at a Las Vegas hotel in which he allegedly stole sports memorabilia. Simpson was acquitted in that trial for the 1994 murders of his exwife, Nicole Brown Simpson."
The F15E must pass an inspection of critical parts on the airframe before returning to flying missions. The F15s were grounded after a crash earlier this month in Missouri of an older model. All U.S. Air Force 224 Emodel aircraft will undergo a onetime inspection of hydraulic system lines.
The Air Force would not say whether the parts being inspected were part of the problem on the aircraft that crashed. The investigation into why that plane fell apart in flight is still ongoing. Air Force officials said the rest of the almost 500 F15s  older airframes will remain grounded until the investigation offers a solution. The Emodel aircraft is heavily used by Central Command for ground support in the U.S.led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"The F15E Strike Eagle is an airtoground and airtoair fighter. It was grounded after a Missouri Air National Guard F15C crashed on November 1. Other Air Force, Navy and French fighters were used to fill the gaps. Strike Eagles did fly to support troops in battle in Afghanistan as an emergency measure while they were still under grounding orders, according to Central Command reports. The plane that crashed was one of the older F15s in the fleet."
"Former detainees of Immigration and Customs Enforcement accuse agency of forcibly injecting them with psychotropic drugs. One of the drugs in question is the potent antipsychotic drug Haldol. Doctors say they are required to see patients in person before such drugs are administered. Two immigrants, Raymond Soeoth of Indonesia and Amadou Diouf of Senegal in West Africa, say they were injected with the drugs against their will."
"Both are plaintiffs in a classaction lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against the government. They are seeking an end to the alleged practice and unspecified damages. Dr. Paul Appelbaum, a professor of psychiatry, law and ethics at Columbia University, reviewed both mens medical records."
"Allegations of ICE forcibly drugging deportees were raised last month by Sen. Joe Lieberman. Lieberman intends to follow up with ICE to ensure that detainees are not drugged unless there is a medical reason to do so. ACLU attorney Ahilan Arulanantham, who is representing Soeoth and Diouf, said, It would be torture to give a powerful antipsychotic drug to somebody who isnt even mentally ill."
"1,073 immigration detainees had medical escorts for deportation since 2003. 56 received psychotropic medications during the removal process. Of those, 33 detainees received medication because of combative behavior with the imminent risk of danger to others andor self, she said. ""I am aware of, and deeply concerned about reports that past practices may not have conformed to ICE detention standards,"" Myers said."
"She added no detainee should be involuntarily medicated without court order, except in emergency situations. Soeoth, a Christian minister from Indonesia, spent 27 months in detention awaiting deportation. Hours before he was to be sent back home on December 7, 2004, he says guards injected him with a mystery drug."
"Soeoth says he was taken to Los Angeles International Airport while in a druginduced stupor. He says airline security refused to transport him, so ICE agents returned him to his cell at Terminal Island near Los Angeles. Terminal Island, once a federal prison, is a crowded facility along the ocean where hundreds of illegal immigrants await deportation. Soeoth denies ever making the remark that he would kill himself if deported."
Diouf says he was injected on the plane right before he was to be deported. He said he even had a federal stay of his deportation  and the paperwork to prove it. But his U.S. government escorts wouldnt let him show it to the pilot of the plane preparing to fly him out of the country.
"Diouf and Soeoth remain in the U.S. pending a decision in the case. If they lose, they may land back in the hands of ICE, once again facing deportation."
"Soeoth says hes traumatized by what happened. I know this country is very generous to immigrants, he says. ""What they did to me was very, very bad,"" he says of the baby sitter."
"Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, of Nevada is being sought as a suspect in the videotaped rape of a young girl. The mother did not know her daughter had ever been victimized and was apparently oblivious to efforts to find her until last Friday."
"The abuse most likely occurred while the mother  a single woman working six days a week was at work. The attorney said he knows who the baby sitter is, but would not release that information because of the ongoing investigation. The mother of the girl asked that the news media leave the family alone."
"The girls videotaped rape set off a nationwide search last week. She was found Friday with family in Las Vegas, Nevada, after thousands of tips poured in. The mother said she is cooperating with investigators and that her daughter is safe and healthy."
"Professionals have since evaluated her and she appears to be healthy and fine and happy, the lawyer said. The lawyer said neither he nor the mother has watched the videotape. Still, he said, he hopes the man in the tape is brought to justice. ""I wish the guy would dig a hole in the desert and put a gun in his mouth,"" he said."
"Stiles former girlfriend Tina Allen says she thinks she is the reason Stiles came in contact with the girl. Allen said she and Stiles were in an onagain, offagain relationship for 10 years until recently, when she called it off. Allen: I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be."
"Also living in the apartment were a family friend and her daughter, who allegedly was victimized by Stiles. The FBI is also seeking Stiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, in a separate matter involving state charges of sexual assault."
"Darren Tuck, a Nevada resident, faces charges of exhibiting pornography and possession of child pornography. Tuck allegedly showed the tape to others before giving it to police. Sen. Barack Obama says Sen. Hillary Clinton has shown flawed judgment. Obama says Clinton helped give President Bush a blank check to take military action against Iran. Obama: Clinton gave President Bush ""a blank check"" to attack Iran."
"Last month, Clinton voted to support a resolution declaring Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite part of the Iranian military, a foreign terrorist group. Obama said he would have voted against the measure but didnt because he was campaigning in New Hampshire at the time."
"Obama said Clinton also had shown flawed judgment during the vote to authorize the Iraq war five years ago. While campaigning Sunday in New Hampton, Iowa, an audience member at a town hallstyle meeting pressed her on why she voted for the Iran measure. Clinton on Thursday defended her vote on the resolution during an interview on New Hampshire Public Radio, saying what I voted on was a nonbinding resolution."
"Obama's comments came on the fifth anniversary of the 7723 Senate vote that authorized the president to use force against Iraq. Obama, then an Illinois state senator, spoke out against the resolution authorizing force at the time. Earlier this month, Clinton also cosponsored legislation with Sen. Jim Webb that would prohibit military operations against Iran without congressional approval."
"Clintons 2002 vote shows a clear difference in judgment between the two of them, Obama said. I think her judgment was flawed on this issue. It speaks to how we will make decisions going forward."
"Obama said he also will step up efforts to clarify his differences with Clinton, whom many political observers view as the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. The first part of a campaign is to offer some biography and give people a sense of where Ive been and what I am about, Obama said. Another leading Democratic candidate, John Edwards, also voted in 2002 to authorize force in Iraq while he was a senator from North Carolina."
"He later called his vote a mistake. In a veiled swipe at Clinton, Obama also suggested he could better unite the country and offer something new. Obama would not say whether he would consider Clinton as his running mate should he become the Democratic Partys nominee. Right now, my goal is to make sure I am the nominee, and she is still the senator from New York."
Bryant Purvis says he is focusing on his studies and practicing basketball. Purvis was facing charges of seconddegree attempted murder and conspiracy. Charges have now been reduced against at least five of the students in the racially charged Jena 6 case. The six black students are accused of being involved in beating a white student.
"Purvis and five other teens are accused of the December 2006 beating of fellow student Justin Barker. Martin Luther King III and Al Sharpton led more than 15,000 marchers to Jena in September. Purvis said he has moved to another town to complete high school. He said he is focusing on his studies and practicing basketball, which he hopes to play in college."
Bells was released in September after his adult criminal conviction for the beating was overturned. He was ordered two weeks later to spend 18 months in a juvenile facility for a probation violation. A district judge tossed out Bells conviction for conspiracy to commit seconddegree battery. The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeal did the same with Bells battery conviction in midSeptember.
"10 Downing Street, the official residence of British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, called on the British government to demand that full democracy be restored in Pakistan. Protesters waved placards and chanted in support of the resignation of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf. The crowd of demonstrators massed behind barriers and included Jemima Khan, the exwife of former Pakistani cricket star turned politician Imran Khan."
"T.I. will remain in custody until a bond hearing Friday, a federal magistrate says. His exwife delivered a petition to a doorman at Downing Street. The petition demands that Pakistan restore democracy and the judiciary. It also calls on Musharraf to release all political prisoners, including lawyers, journalists and opposition politicians."
"The entertainer, whose real name is Clifford Harris, was arrested Saturday just hours before he was scheduled to perform at the BET Hip Hop Awards. The small court room of Magistrate Judge Alan Baverman was packed with family, supporters and media. Even more people, including the rappers mother, were turned away because of the overcrowding."
"Authorities said that Harris provided the bodyguard 12,000 to buy the weapons. Harris is not allowed to own because he is a convicted felon. Court documents said Harris was convicted on felony drug charges in 1998. However, one of his attorneys, Dwight Thomas, said he was not aware Harris was a felon."
The entertainer was taken into custody about 230 p.m. Saturday in Atlanta. Authorities said they found three more firearms in the car in which Harris drove to pick up the machine guns and silencers. One loaded gun was tucked between the drivers seat where Harris had been sitting and the center console. The show went on without the selfproclaimed King of the South.
"At his home, authorities found six other guns, five of them loaded, in his bedroom closet. Machine guns pose a serious danger to the community, U.S. attorney says. The sting came after Harris bodyguard was arrested purchasing the machine guns and silencers from an undercover Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent."
"The guns were not registered on the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record as required by law. The bodyguard  told authorities he had bought about nine guns for the rap star in the past. After his arrest, the bodyguard made phone calls to Harris, which authorities recorded."
"Harris was supposed to meet the bodyguard in a shopping center parking lot in midtown Atlanta. Authorities arrested Harris there without incident, the Justice Department said. Court documents in the case show Harris was convicted on felony drug charges in Cobb County, Georgia, in 1998."
"Three Chinese nationals accused of importing thousands of counterfeit luxury handbags. Harris soon will appear in the movie American Gangster, starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. The film is set to open November 2."
"Authorities call it one of the largest counterfeit operations ever discovered. It involved about 300,000 bags and wallets with names like Burberry, Gucci and Coach. They paid a total of about 16 million for what would have been more than 100 million in handbags, purses and wallets in legitimate retail sales."
"The alleged leaders of the counterfeit operations are three Chinese citizens living in New York. Chong Lam, 49, and Joyce Chan, 39, were arrested there Wednesday. Eric Yuen was arrested Thursday in Las Vegas, Nevada."
"The charges were unsealed when the alleged conspirators were taken into custody. Authorities seized and froze 29 bank accounts and three New York properties. The Chinese defendants will be taken to Richmond, where they will be arraigned at a later date."
Proenza is still employed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Deputy Director Ed Rappaport has been temporarily placed in charge. Proenza caused an uproar last month with comments about a key hurricane satellite. The satellite is five years beyond its life expectancy and operating on a backup transmitter.
"Proenza said if it were to fail, forecast tracks could be thrown off by as much as 16 percent. He said Washington reprimanded him for the remarks. But one of the centers longtime forecasters said Proenzas comments were misguided."
"The Commerce Department launched an unscheduled review of the hurricane center after word of the staffs dissatisfaction started to become public. His staffers on Thursday issued a petition calling for him to step down. The petition said the centers effective functioning is at stake as the Atlantic hurricane season heads toward its peak. The undersigned staff... has concluded that the center needs a new director, and urges the Department of Commerce to make this happen as quickly as possible."
"Proenza says he has contacted his superiors in Washington about ways to move forward. Proenza graduated from Florida State University with a degree in meteorology. He began his career in tropical meteorology in the mid1960s at NHC. He was a meteorologist on the hurricane hunter aircraft, according to his biography posted on the agencys Web site."
"More than 1,700 people have died in Bangladesh after a devastating tropical cyclone. Aid workers say they expect to find scores more bodies when remote villages are finally reached and the counting is done. Gen. Qazi Abedus Samad, director of operations for the countrys armed forces, told CNN Saturday the toll had reached 1,723, and the figure is expected to rise. He continued within the National Weather Service for more than 35 years."
"Cyclone Sidr made landfall Thursday night along the western coast of Bangladesh near the border with India. Thousands of people have been displaced and many are still missing. The government held an emergency Cabinet meeting Saturday to assess the disaster and discuss recovery issues. They face debrisblocked roads, no electricity and almost nonexistent communications."
"Bangladeshi air force, army and navy are working to provide shelter for the many people who have been displaced. Power is still out in much of the country but it is being restored. The government has identified the 12 worst districts all of them located on the southern coast."
"High wind speeds of Cyclone Sidr have laid waste to the allimportant rice crop and caused a huge loss of livestock. 280,000 families have been rendered homeless by the cyclone, but many have been able to get shelter from family members. World Vision is deploying 135 staffers and 7,000 volunteers to provide food, shelter and other relief."
"Power outages, massive traffic jams and spotty phone service are reported in Dhaka. Red Crescent spokeswoman Nabiha Chowdhury says 15,000 people are injured and 1,000 are missing. She says 600,000 have fled the area, including 2 million who live along the coast. The Red Crescent has resources with them to immediately help people with water purification, she says, which is a top priority."
"The U.N. World Food Programme says it has enough highenergy biscuits to feed 400,000 people for several days. Another humanitarian group, Save The Children, appealed for aid from the public. Many families have lost everything, including their homes and their crops, and they are struggling to survive."
"U.S. prepositioned 16 Zodiac boats, water treatment systems, water ambulances and food for a more rapid response. Defense Secretary Robert Gates was expected to approve plans to send up to three Navy amphibious warships, with up to 3,500 Marines, to locations off the coast of Bangladesh. A man has been indicted on federal charges for allegedly displaying hangmans nooses from the back of a pickup truck during a civil rights march."
"Jeremiah Munsen, 18, of Grant Parish, repeatedly drove slowly past a group of marchers. As many as 20,000 marchers had taken part in the huge protests in Jena. Authorities there had been accused of injustice in the handling of racially charged cases. The noose incident at Jena was the beginning of months of racial tension that included the beating of a white student."
"Munsen and an unnamed conspirator had attached nooses to their pickup on September 20. A juvenile passenger was apprehended with Munsen, according to the arresting officers report. The juvenile told police he and his family are in the Ku Klux Klan and that he had KKK tattooed on his chest."
"This indictment accuses the defendant Munsen of conduct that constitutes a federal civil rights conspiracy violation and a federal hate crime. A photograph of the truck was sent to CNN by IReporter Casanova Love, 26, who said he is in the U.S. military. Love added, If the police had not stepped in, I fear what might have happened."
"The song Until the Day Is Done also will appear later this month in Planet in Peril. The fourhour CNN documentary looks at environmental crises around the world. R.E.M. singer Michael Stipe says the band was honored to be involved with the project. The images in the film are beautiful, while at the same time heartbreaking and frightening, he says."
We are honored to have our song included in this monumental project. Planet in Peril executive producer Charlie Moore said the groups longstanding commitment to environmental causes made them a natural choice for the project.
"Moore said they contacted R.E.M. earlier this year to see if the group would be willing to write a song to go with the documentary. He said the group, their management and their record label were eager to be involved. Its sort of serendipitous that we were able to work something out with them, Moore said."
"Planet in Peril features CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta and Animal Planet host and wildlife biologist Jeff Corwin. The twopart documentary was filmed in 13 countries and focuses on the issues of climate change, deforestation, species loss and overpopulation. CNN will air the documentary on October 23 and 24 at 9 p.m."
"R.E.M. says it has finished recording songs for new album. Band also is releasing a live CDDVD on Tuesday with 22tracks recorded at a 2005 concert in Dublin, Ireland. Eloisa Tamez said she isnt scared anymore, just determined."
"The U.S. government wants to build a border fence like this one. About 100 landowners are fighting it. The property is a remnant of a 12,000acre grant from Spain to her family in 1767."
"This week, the Justice Department began legal action against landowners who have refused to give government surveyors access to their land. Tamez expects she will be sued sometime soon, but she is not intimidated. Asked how long she will fight, she said, As long as I have to."
Chertoff believes a fence would curb the steady stream of illegal immigrants. He also argues it will increase the safety of Border Patrol agents. The government wants to build 700 miles of fence along the Mexican border.
About 70 miles of fence is to be built in the Rio Grande Valley by years end. The Rio Grande forms a natural barrier along this stretch of the border. But in some places it is narrow enough to swim across.
"The Border Patrol has stepped up its efforts in the Rio Grande Valley with more lights, and sensors to pick up movement. A levee built along the river has a muddy road on top used by Border Patrol vehicles to patrol the area. The mayor of the border town of McAllen, Texas, believes hiring more Border Patrol agents would provide better border protection than the fence."
Cortez and other border mayors formed a group called the Texas Border Coalition. The coalition wrote to Chertoff asking for further consultations on the fence. This week the Department of Homeland Security turned them down.
"Cortez said his city is contemplating a court test of the law that mandated the construction of the border fence. U.S. Customs and Border Protection wrote in an email that they do not plan to suspend work on the fence. ""I have an Americangiven right to protect my property,"" Eloisa Tamez said."
"Some Christian congregations are turning to the Church of Scientology. Scientologists do not worship God, much less Jesus Christ. The church has seen plenty of controversy and critics consider it a cult. So why are observant Christians embracing some of its teachings?"
"Two pastors say they are not scared off by programs with ties to Scientology. Critics say Scientology has aggressive recruiting, secretive ways and rigid theology. The Rev. James McLaughlin of the Wayman Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Houston, Texas, is one of the pastors who spoke with CNN."
"Scientology was founded in the 1950s by L. Ron Hubbard, a science fiction writer. Followers are taught that they are immortal spiritual beings called thetans. Although the church says there is a supreme being, its practices do not include worshipping God."
"Scientology has long been in the headlines for practices critics say are little more than cultlike mind control. Critic Rick Ross, a courtcertified Scientology expert, sees something more sinister at work. He warned that mainstream acceptance makes it easier for the Scientologists to achieve their ultimate goal  new recruits."
"Scientology has been recently diversifying its outreach to include other religions and ethnic groups. Kennedy, McLaughlin and a handful of other Christian church leaders  no one can say how many are finding answers to their communities needs in Scientologys social programs. It is also known for its stable of devout celebrity followers."
"Kennedy found a message he believed could help lift his predominantly lower income AfricanAmerican congregation. He said the books 21 principles help them with their struggle in an urban environment. Kennedy knew that before he could introduce any Scientologyrelated text to his congregation, he would have to prove that it did not contradict his Christian beliefs. And so, he found Scripture to match each of the 21 principles."
"He believes it is easier to understand and clearer to follow than ancient Scriptures taken from the Bible. When asked whether Scientologys values contradict the religion of Jesus Christ, Kennedy replies, Sometimes yes. But he says his congregation can relate to The Way to Happiness."
"At Kennedys C. L. Kennedy Center, free tutoring based on Hubbards study tech philosophies is provided to dozens of children and some adults. Jimirra Kennedy insists she does not ascribe to the religious side of Scientology, she still considers herself, at least in part, Scientologist."
"Critics like Ross are alarmed by such a blurring of the lines. They consider it a marketing win for Scientology. In Houston, McLaughlin says he is not one to argue with success. McLaughlin spent years searching for a solution before he discovered Narconon."
McLaughlin trained at Narconon and brought the techniques back to his community to launch First Step Faith Step. He claims a 70 to 80percent rehabilitation success rate. Kennedy and McLaughlin said they have never lost a member of their congregations to Scientology.
"The Church of Scientology would not grant CNN an interview. The attack occurred Tuesday near an office housing judicial police in the city of Thenia. The blast destroyed about 20 houses, and a commission has been appointed to look after the victims, the Algerian Press Service said. It occurred about 50 km 31 miles east of the capital of Algiers."
Islamic extremists in Algeria and other North African countries have struck several times in recent years. An al Qaeda affiliate claimed responsibility last year for the deadliest attack in Algiers in 10 years. Al Qaeda also took responsibility for a January 2 bombing that killed four and wounded 20 at a building housing security forces. Suspended Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick tested positive for marijuana in a September 13 drug test.
"Vick tested positive for the drug on September 13, a court document shows. He must submit to any method of testing required by the pretrial services officer or the supervising officer. Those methods could include random drug testing, a remote alcohol testing system andor any form of prohibited substance screening or testing. Vick, 27, must participate in substance abuse therapy and mental health counseling if deemed advisable."
"The conditions are to apply until Vicks sentencing, which is set for December 10. This is a very difficult time for Mr. Vick, said Billy Martin, Vicks lead defense counsel. He will comply with the courts new conditions regarding release."
"Vick faces a possible prison term of 12 to 18 months after his August guilty plea. The original terms of the pretrial release required that Vick not use narcotic drugs or other controlled substances unless prescribed by a doctor. On Tuesday, a Virginia grand jury indicted Vick and the three codefendants on state charges of running a dogfighting ring at the home. See a timeline of the case against Vick here."
The Surry County grand jury brought two charges against Vick. One count of unlawfully torturing and killing dogs and one of promoting dogfights. Vick will be arraigned October 3 in state court in Virginia.
"Paul McCartney: We were just kids from Liverpool. Ringo Starr: We thought wed be really big in Liverpool. McCartney: ""As time goes on, it kind of becomes more and more of a phenomenon"" The former Beatles appeared on CNN's Larry King Live Tuesday in Las Vegas. The show airs at 8 p.m. ET on CNN."
"I think the most exciting thing is that, you know, we expect people our age to know the music. And if anything is left, we have left really good music, and thats the important part, not the moptops or whatever."
"And then I joined and then they got this record deal and look what happened. No, we were good, McCartney retorted. You wanted to join us. You begged"
"McCartney and Starr were in Las Vegas with Yoko Ono Lennon and Olivia Harrison, the widows of John Lennon and George Harrison. Harrison said her husband was friends with Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberte and came up with the idea before he died of cancer in 2001."
John Lennon was shot near the couples New York apartment in 1980. Neither woman has remarried and they both said it was still sometimes difficult to deal with their losses.
I mean their presence is very powerful and very strong. But the incredible thing about them is that they  everything they left the world and left us is uplifting and joyful. The Beatles music received a bit of a facelift for the show and has been remixed in 5.1 surround sound.
"You know you can hear everything now. Things that we buried a lot. Its all very clear, so its really great to hear it. Most historic stuff goes down with age, you know? Winston Churchills old papers go brown"
"McCartneys latest solo album, Memorys Almost Full, is No. 3 on the album charts. Starr is scheduled to release a greatest hits album in August. Three Palestinians, including two sick children, have died recently while waiting for resettlement from Iraq."
"About 2,000 Palestinian refugees are stranded in camps along the Syrian border. U.N. appeals for the resettlement of vulnerable and sick children in Al Waleed refugee camp. One of those who died in the camp was a 3yearold Palestinian boy who was suffering from rickets and pneumonia."
"Seven people, including three children, have died at the camp since 2006. About 30 to 40 people arrive at the Al Waleed camp each week. UNHCR has helped resettle one family of eight with several sick children from this camp to Norway last August."
"UNHCR has sought solutions for the whole group since last year. Thousands of Palestinians have lived in Iraq, with some going there when Israel was formed. The UNHCR notes that some got preferential treatment under the regime of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein."
"Friends of Michio Kanda last heard from him via satellite phone at 9 a.m. Alaska time. When he missed three subsequent scheduled calls over the next six hours, they called the Coast Guard. Kanda was on a solo flight from Japan to the west coast United States. He was last seen at 6 p.m., U.S. Coast Guard said."
"Two Coast Guard C130 Hercules planes conducted searches Thursday 435 miles south of Adak, Alaska. Two Coast Guard cutters are also headed for the area, but both are at least a day away. Kanda holds the world record for the longestduration balloon flight, with a time of 50 hours and 38 minutes."
"Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama will duel for Super Tuesday votes. The Democratic presidential hopefuls face off for the first time together. The debate is taking place at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles, California. It is sponsored by CNN, the Los Angeles Times and Politico."
"The event is the first Democratic debate since Obamas convincing victory Saturday in South Carolina. The forum at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood comes hours after the Obama campaign revealed it had raised 32 million in January from roughly 170,000 new donors."
"The Clinton campaign would not indicate how much money it had raised in the same time period. Mike Gravel, the other Democratic presidential candidate still in the race, was not invited to participate in the debate. In a CNNOpinion Research Corporation poll conducted January 1417, Gravel received less than 1 percent."
"Edwards suspended his presidential run Wednesday in New Orleans, Louisiana, but he didnt endorse any candidate despite what aides described as furious lobbying campaigns by Obama and Clinton. The economy is likely to dominate Thursdays debate, as both candidates look to appeal to supporters of Edwards and his brand of economic populism."
"Clinton and Obama have split victories in their parties earlyvoting states. Obama has won in Iowa and South Carolina, and Clinton in New Hampshire, Nevada, Michigan and Florida. All major Democratic presidential candidates pledged to avoid campaigning in those states following national party penalties against them for moving up their contests so early."
Superdelegates are party leaders and elected officials who are not obligated to support a particular candidate. They can change their decisions at any time leading up to the Democratic National Convention in August. Obama has won an estimated 63 national convention delegates as a result of primary or caucus votes. Clinton has earned an estimated 48 delegates.
"Car bomb struck a U.S. Embassy vehicle as it traveled along a coastal highway north of Beirut. At least three Lebanese civilian bystanders were killed in the blast. The driver of the embassy vehicle suffered minor injuries, and the sole passenger walked away unscathed. Clinton has led in national surveys for much of the race."
"An American citizen who happened to be in the area suffered nonlifethreatening injuries. The United States is outraged by the terrorist attack, says Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. The explosion was caused by a 15kilogram 33pound bomb placed in a car before the explosion, security forces say."
"It was not clear whether the blast was caused by a suicide attack or by a remotely detonated car bomb. A communique issued by the U.S. Embassy in Beirut said the embassy vehicle was apparently the intended target of the attack. The driver and passenger of the car were Lebanese security personnel for the embassy, the embassy said in a statement."
"U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Jeffrey Feltman canceled a farewell ceremony Tuesday night out of respect to the victims of todays terrorist explosion. An Iraqi and at least three Lebanese were among those wounded in the blast, according to a Western diplomatic source. McCormack would also not address unconfirmed reports that the vehicle was part of a convoy for departing U.s. ambassador."
"Video of the scene showed several damaged cars, including at least one that was left a pile of twisted metal. A nearby highrise building also sustained damage. Tuesday's blast appears to be the latest in a series of attacks against proWestern, antiSyrian targets in the Lebanese capital."
Brig. Gen. Francois AlHajj was killed in an explosion on December 12. He was believed to be a top candidate to take over as army commander if Michel Suleiman was elected president. Lebanon has been in the midst of a political crisis as lawmakers are locked in a battle to elect a new president.
"In February 2005, the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in Beirut sparked widespread protests that led to the ouster of Syrian forces from Lebanon. In August of77, Bobby Murcer of the Cubs promised to hit a home run for terminally ill fan Scott Crull."
"Crull Murcer, 12, from Calumet City, Illinois, made this list. Murcer only hit nine homers the whole next season. Keith Jackson told the country how Murcer had fulfilled the dying boys last wish."
"Weeks later, Crull passed away. Tossing the eighttentacled cephalopod was the brainchild of Detroit storeowners Pete  Jerry Cusimano."
"The Red Wings mascot is not a Red Wing, but Al the Octopus. Also known as Rainbow Man, the bornagain Rollen Stewart and his John 316 signs were fixtures at major events in the 1970s and 80s."
"He brought his message to the World Series, Super Bowl, Olympics, and World Cup. He planned to assassinate President Bush and candidate Clinton in 1992. He is now serving three life sentences for holding a maid hostage at a Los Angeles Hyatt."
"For 12 years, Maryland lawyer and Washington Bullets fan Robin Ficker was the NBAs most prominent heckler. With season tickets behind the visiting teams bench, his antics were legendary. When he reminded Frank Layden of the Jazz that USA Today had rated him Worst Dressed Coach, Layden had to be restrained by security."
"During the 1993 SunsBulls NBA Finals, Charles Barkley of the Suns flew Ficker to Phoenix and bought him a ticket behind the Chicago bench. Ficker was ejected in the first quarter. The Bullets became the Wizards in 1997 and moved into the MCI Center the following season."
"Last year he received 9.5 of the vote in a losing bid for Montgomery County Executive. The Chicago Bulls are the favorite team of Kim Jongil, who reportedly has a video library with every game Jordan ever played. At 53, the Supreme Commander of the Korean Peoples Army is roughly the same height as Muggsy Bogues."

Also receiving votes John Hinckley the fan who started the PistonsPacers brawl in 2004 Jeffrey Maier The Kissing Bandit Butch from Middlebury Metallica superfanturnedbass player Jason Newstead."
"Disability charity Scope says the move could infringe human rights. Andy Rickell, executive director of disability charity Scope, says it is difficult to see how this kind of invasive surgery can be in Katies best interests. If this enforced sterilization is approved, it will have disturbing implications for young disabled girls across Britain."
"Katies mother Alison Thorpe, who lives in Billericay, southern England, said the operation was in her daughters best interests. If it was about me, I would have given up caring for Katie a long, long while ago, she said."
"Katie wouldnt understand menstruation at all. She has no comprehension about what will be happening to her body. All she would feel is the discomfort, the stomach cramps and the headaches, the mood swings, the tears, and wonder what is going on."
"The number eight ba is considered auspicious by many in China because it sounds like the word for wealth and fortune. A traditional Mingstyle wedding is held in Nanjing, China, last December. Weve long been prepared for a stampede of newlywed couples this year, Guo Xusheng, spokesman with the Beijing Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau says."
"Nearly 3,400 couples got hitched on the day last year, some waiting all night outside the marriage registration office in Beijing. This year, the civil affairs bureau is accepting online reservations for marriage registrations for the day. The significance that numbers carry in Chinese culture often dictate various aspects of the peoples lives there."

Coalition troops kill al Qaeda terrorist who masterminded attack on mosque. Haitham Sabah alBadri masterminded February 2006 attack on Samarras alAskariya mosque. Attack set off continuing violence and reprisal killings between Sunnis and Shiites. Portugal go through from Group A after a goalless home draw against qualification rivals Finland while group winners Poland completed their program with a 22 draw away to Serb Serbia.
"Coalition forces raided four buildings outside Samarra associated with alBadri. At least four armed men were seen leaving the buildings and setting up tactical fighting positions. The coalition forces called in close air support, killing al badri and the three others. One of those killed was identified as a foreigner alBadRI was identified by his close associates and relatives."
"ElBadris death was first reported Saturday by a highranking Iraqi Interior Ministry official. No one was injured in the attack on the Golden Mosque, one of the holiest Shiite sites. Thousands have been killed by the death squads and reprisal bombings that have ravaged Iraq in the 17½ months since the attack. AlBadri is believed to have been involved in other attacks, including two last year."
Two mortar rounds struck a gas station in a mainly Shiite neighborhood in eastern Baghdad. The attack in the Afdhailiya neighborhood happened about 8 a.m. The U.S. military says it killed four suspected militants and detained 18. The militants were suspected of coordinating logistical support from Iran for elements of Shiite cleric Muqtada alSadrs Mehdi Army.
"Iraqi family upset with U.S. soldiers sentence. Jesse Spielman was convicted Friday of rape, conspiracy to commit rape and four counts of felony murder. The girl, her parents and younger sister were shot dead in March 2006 in Mahmoudiya, south of Baghdad. The girls family told Reuters on Sunday they were dismayed by the punishment."
"We were expecting the death penalty against those criminals, the girls cousin, Abu Ammar, told Reuters. Three soldiers have previously pleaded guilty in the case. The accused ringleader, former Pvt. Steven Green, was discharged from the Army and awaits trial in a civilian court."
"Richard Roberts stepped down Friday, according to the schools Board of Regents. Roberts is the son of Oral Roberts University's namesake evangelist founder. ""I love ORU with all my heart. I want to see Gods best for them,"" Roberts wrote in his resignation letter."
"Roberts decision was effective immediately and came as the school fought a wrongful termination lawsuit filed by three professors. John Swails, Tim Brooker and Paulita Brooker said they lost their jobs after reporting information indicating that Roberts and his family lavishly spent school money for personal expenses. The suit also claimed Oral Roberts University gave a convicted sexual deviant unrestricted access to students."
"Board of Regents will meet early next week to discuss a new president. Roberts announced last month he would step aside temporarily as president. Thousands lined the streets of Beirut Friday to honor Antoine Ghanem, the antiSyrian Lebanese MP killed in a powerful bomb blast along with four others. The controversy has drawn international attention to the private Christian university in Tulsa, Oklahoma."
"Flagdraped coffins of the politician and two bodyguards also killed in Wednesdays rush hour blast made its way through the citys Christian district. The procession was accompanied by thousands waving flags, as well as a brass band playing the anthem of Ghanems Phalange Party. Several people were seen to collapse and had to be carried away."
"Mourners carry photographs, throw rose petals and unfurled banners, AP says. Ghanem was later buried in the citys Christian district. His death is the latest in a series of attacks targeting prominent anti-Syrian figures. The most notorious was the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, which sparked widespread protests."
"The incident threatens to cast the country into political uncertainty ahead of a key presidential vote. U.S. President George W. Bush, in a written statement, joined other world leaders in condemning the horrific assassination. CNNs Beirut bureau chief Brent Sadler said that many Lebanese now feared for the future, especially given other events in the region."
"Since October 2004, there has been a tragic pattern of political assassinations and attempted assassinations, Bush says. The U.S. opposes any attempts to intimidate the Lebanese people as they seek to exercise their democratic right to select a president without foreign interference, he says. A spokesperson for Ban Kimoon says the U.N. secretarygeneral condemns in the strongest terms this terrorist attack. The secretary general urges all Lebanese to exercise utmost calm and restraint at this very critical time."
"The U.S. Embassy in Beirut issued a statement saying It is not a coincidence that these attacks target those figures who have been working to secure Lebanons independence from renewed Syrian hegemony. Many Lebanese politicians allied with Syria have in fact warned that murder and violence would be the results of any effort to exercise genuine parliamentary democracy, the embassy said. The bombing that claimed these lives was another act in a campaign of terror by those who want to turn back the clock on Lebanons hardwon democratic gains."
"Police make a string of arrests across Europe, detaining 20 people. Arrests are suspected of involvement in the recruitment of suicide bombers. Eleven of the arrests were in Italy, in the northern cities of Milan, Reggio Emilia, Bergamo, and San Remo. One was already in custody, so authorities served him with a new arrest warrant."
"The remaining arrests happened in European countries but Sandulli did not specify which ones. Those arrested are suspected of forming Salafi Jihad terrorist cells. Police found al Qaeda manuals for the production of explosives, detonation devices, and various poisons. Salafi is an extreme school of Islamic thought which developed in Egypt and began to have prominence with militant groups there in the late 1960s and has since been adopted by terrorist groups."
"The Madrid train bombers and various terrorist cells in Italy were part of the Salafi school of thought, he added. The main suspect in the operation is a Tunisian who was arrested in 2002 during a separate antiterrorism operation, police said."
"The main terrorist cell was based in the northern Italian region of Lombardy. Another cell, based in Reggio Emilia, had the goal of creating a grand Islamic empire stretching from Morocco to China. Those arrested are also accused of producing false documents and facilitating illegal immigration."
The models strutting down the runway were of the fourlegged variety. The glamorous pooches were accompanied by human models but the furry ones were getting all the attention. It was Pet Fashion Week New York and these canines were not wearing the boring plaid raincoats that have sold for years.
Mira Nair is the director of Monsoon Wedding and Salaam Bombay! She spoke to CNN at the Bollywood Movie Awards in Long Island. The Namesake is Nair's adaptation of Jhumpa Lahiris novel about loss and family. The show was aimed at owners of sophisticated canines who may be willing to pay for their pups own stylist.
"Mira Nair read The Namesake while in huge grief with the death of a beloved person to me Miras mother in law. In it Jhumpa writes really acutely of a loss of a parent in a foreign country, and I thought I had been understood by someone. It was also a story that linked the two cities in which I had grown up Calcutta and New York City."
"It just spoke to me and I felt compelled to do this film. Its filmed in both India and New York, such different cultures. Nair Well, the story of movement and crossings is as old as the hills."
"Its a tale of millions of us that have left one home for another, and tried to find out who we are through these places. It is also equally a love story between two people who come from a culture who dont send roses and diamonds for love who sit at a kitchen table and look at each other."
"Nair's 15-year-old son said, This has to be your Gogol. Penn became an actor because he had seen Mississippi Masala when he was eight years old. Nair had no idea that he existed until her son said it. ""I didnt take him seriously at all until every night the campaign mounted at home Tell me in the morning its Kal Penn!"""
"He came to my office and auditioned and he was just so appealing, and so much the real thing, that I cast him as Gogol. Its not that different a kind of audience, thats what pleases me. we really made for the children on the streets and the kids who really love that Bollywood stuff."
"But no, they dont come to my films for Bollywood fare its a completely alternative thing. In India it is more about orchestrating chaos, and its about sifting the chaos. In America its about paying for the chaos, you know every head has to be placed there and paid for."
"CNN The Namesake is about not losing the identity of Indian culture. I am at home in many cultures. I live actively in three continents and Ive done that for most of my life. I just make films as I see the world, and that happens to speak to people."
A grand jury indicted four suspects on charges of first degree felony murder and armed burglary. A grand jury identified Eric Rivera Jr. as the shooter in the death of NFL star Sean Taylor. Do Indian and American audiences behave differently? I think films have to reach people and really grab them.
"The three adult suspects appeared in court Tuesday via videoconference wearing thick green vests, which defense attorneys said were suicide safety smocks. They were ordered held without bail at the PreTrial Detention Center in Miami, Florida, where Corrections Officer Janelle Hall said they are under suicide watch. The fourth suspect  Eric Rivera Jr., 17, remained in custody in Fort Myers, Florida."
"Sean Maurice Taylor, 24, died a day after he was shot during an apparent burglary at his home. The four men were arrested Friday, officials said. MiamiDade police investigators said they believe the burglars thought the house was empty. Watch CNN's Rick Sanchez speak to attorneys for two of the suspects."
"Thousands of mourners attended Taylors funeral Monday at Florida International Universitys arena. Police said Taylor and his girlfriend, Jackie Garcia, were awakened by noise coming from the living room early November 26."
A breakin had been reported at Taylors residence eight days earlier. A police report from that incident said someone forced a window open and left a kitchen knife on a bed. Several drawers and a bedroom safe were searched during the breakin.
"Taylor spent four years with the Redskins, earning his first Pro Bowl selection in 2006. He suffered a sprained right knee in a November 11 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. The 2004 firstround draft pick played at the University of Miami."
"Michael Mazza, 40, was arrested outside a pawn shop in Hollywood, Florida. Death of Broward County Deputy Paul Rein sparked a massive manhunt. Mazza was being taken to the second day of his trial in connection with the armed robbery of a Coral Springs bank. It was the third shooting of aBroward County sheriffs deputy in four months."
"Mazza and Rein left about 805 a.m., Lamberti said. Minutes later, a truck driver who saw all or part of the altercation near Pompano Beach called 911."
"The struggle began when Rein apparently pulled the medical transport van over at an intersection. Mazza allegedly took Reins service weapon away from him and shot him. After the shooting, Mazza is believed to have thrown Rein from the van and driven away."
"A city public works employee later spotted the bloodspattered van in Fort Lauderdale. Mazza is believed to have hitchhiked his way down to Hollywood. He approached a man at a pawn shop and asked for a ride. The man, who was headed to a second pawn shop, agreed."
"As he was talking to the clerk, a television in the shop began broadcasting news about the deputys shooting, and showed a picture of Mazza. Mazza was arrested shortly afterward. Reins gun was found with Mazza in the mans car, the sheriff said."
"Mazza faces charges including firstdegree murder and escape. Mazza initially was reluctant to talk to authorities, but later agreed, the sheriff says. He was serving a life sentence for robbing a drugstore in Coconut Creek, Lamberti says. The sheriff says Mazza will be housed at another facility outside of Broward County, Dade County."
Mazza was dressed in civilian clothes  a suit rather than jail scrubs Wednesday. He was on trial for robbery of the Coral Springs bank. Broward County also has a pending case against Mazza for a February drugstore robbery. Police are investigating whether he had planned the escape in advance.
Reins coworkers told reporters he was in outstanding condition physically. Broward County deputies conduct some 400 to 500 inmate court transports a day. Thin staffing and scant resources prevent more than one deputy being involved.
"As news of the escape broke, all 273 schools in Broward County went on lockdown. Lamberti said Reins wife spoke to her husband by cell phone just 10 minutes before he was shot. She said you never think its going to happen to you, the sheriff said."
"U.S. attorney in San Francisco has opened a federal criminal investigation into the crash of the MV Cosco Busan. The captain and crew were barred by law from leaving the vessel, which is docked for repairs in Oakland, the Coast Guard said. Nearly 400 birds were killed in the crash and oil spill, which prompted a federal investigation. The Coast Guard says human error factors probably were involved in the accident."
"The Cosco Busan was departing Oakland for South Korea when it struck a tower supporting the western suspension span of the Bay Bridge. About 58,000 gallons of heavyduty bunker oil poured out of the vessel as it was moored near Treasure Island. Adm. Thad Allen, Coast Guard commandant: ""There were probably some human error factors, but we need to determine the facts"""
Allen defends the Coast Guard against criticism of its response to the spill. The oil sickened birds and formed globules on more than 20 of the areas beaches. It oozed along the San Francisco city waterfront and out of the bay.
"Boxer said the Coast Guard initially reported that the ships owner had said only 140 gallons had spilled from the Cosco Busan. Boxer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California have called for congressional hearings into the accident and resulting spill. Response was set into play within an hour of the event itself, Allen said Monday."
"The NTSB is interviewing the pilot, the ships crew, and other pilots who were on the water at the time of the crash. The crew had been on its inaugural voyage on the ship, which the current owner purchased last month. The NTSB also intends to review the ships voyage data recorder, which should have recorded captain and crew conversations on the bridge."
"Angel Island State Park, the Bays largest island, reopened Monday. Schwarzenegger has declared a state of emergency, freeing money to clean up the spill. Seven miles of containment boom stretched across the bay has collected more than 12,271 gallons of oil so far. Nearly 400 dead birds have been recovered from the bay."
"In 1989, the oil tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground and fouled Alaskas Prince William Sound with almost 11 million gallons of crude. Thousands of birds and animals died in the disaster. Twenty wildlife teams were scheduled Monday to be the bay, working to find sick birds so they can be rehabilitated."
"On Sunday, the states other U.S. senator and a leading Coast Guard official decried the accident. This an incident which, in my view, should not have happened, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, DCalifornia, said. Rear Adm. Craig E. Bone, the Coast Guards director of inspection and compliance, echoed Feinsteins comments."
"A British hotel chain is promising free accommodation to couples who share their first names with the couple from the Christian Nativity story. The California Department of Transportation said the collision did no structural damage to the bridge. There was no interruption of bridge traffic  more than 250,000 vehicles daily, according to the department."
"Almost 30 Josephs and Marys had already signed up for the free nights stay at the Travelodge. The offer is good at any one of the chains 322 hotels in the United Kingdom. The couples must bring proof of identity and must prove that they are in a longterm relationship. If you satisfy the criteria, you get a free night in a family room for two adults and two children."
"The offer will run from Christmas Eve to Twelfth Night December 24 to January 5. Couples can register their names at a special email address set up by Travelodge, which has hotels across the Britain, Ireland and Spain. Theres also parking space for a donkey if needed, she joked."
"Journalist Eric Weiner wanted to explore the relationship between place and happiness. He made it his mission to find the most content places around the globe. He uncovered lots of surprises along the way, including a tropical paradise in South Africa."
"A warm climate doesnt necessarily make a happy nation, Weiner said. Money can degrade happiness, he found. Weiner wrote the book, The Geography of Bliss One Grumps Search for the Happiest Places in the World."
"Weiner spent 10 years as a foreign correspondent for National Public Radio. His job took him to some of the least happy places in the world. A world map of happiness, based on 100 different studies, listed Denmark as the worlds happiest nation. But for Weiner, the place where he felt the most bliss was a tossup between Bhutan and Iceland."
"Weiners list of favorites also included Thailand, India and Switzerland. Bhutan is probably the closest thing on Earth to ShangriLa, Weiner explained. He pointed out that while other countries focus on their gross domestic product, the Himalayan kingdom proudly touts its policy of gross national happiness."
"The Bhutanese very much believe that happiness should be part and parcel of every government decision, Weiner said. He visited the country during winter and said he found a certain beauty in the cold and the darkness."
"The cold inspires people to cooperate, traditionally. Simple pleasures like trains arriving on time contributed to national happiness, he said. People in cold climates have to cooperate or they die together."
"The Swiss eat a lot of chocolate, and lets not forget that, Weiner said. He was also impressed with how the Swiss view money. Their attitude is that if youve got it, hide it."
The United States came in at No. 23 on the University of Leicesters world map of happiness. The relationship between money and happiness took Weiner to the Middle East and Qatar. He went there specifically to examine what happens when the entire country wins the lottery.
"He found the wealth made the residents comfortable, but also degraded their level of contentment. There are no income taxes in Qatar, but thats not a cause for contentment, Weiner found. Some taxation is necessary for happiness because its a way of being invested in a place, he argued."
"In a country where theres no taxation at all, people dont have vested interests in how well the government performs. You cant say,Hey, those are my tax dollars at work. Weiners book has struck a chord, recently rising to the top 10 of The New York Times nonfiction bestseller list."
"Daniel Gilbert is a psychology professor at Harvard University and the author of Stumbling on Happiness. Gilbert said its only recently that a combination of biology, sociology and psychology has been able to answer the wheres and whys of happiness. The quest for happiness is the central preoccupation of human beings and has been for as long as there have been human beings, Gilbert said."
A Saudi Arabian human rights attorney is asking the government to allow him to represent a woman who was gangraped. The woman was sentenced to prison for speaking out about the case. Human rights groups want Saudi Arabias King Abdullah to drop charges against the rape victim.
"The attorney, Abdulrahman alLahim, had his license revoked last week by a judge for speaking to the Saudicontrolled media about the case. The judge more than doubled the sentence against his 19-year-old client because she spoke to the media. CNN has been unable to reach Saudi government officials for comment on this report, despite repeated requests."
"The case has sparked outrage among human rights groups. AlLahim had petitioned the court to sentence the attackers to the death penalty. Barring the lawyer from representing the victim in court is almost equivalent to the rape crime itself, says Fawzeyah alOyouni, founding member of Saudi Association for the Defense of Womens Rights."
"Human Rights Watch calls on King Abdullah to void the verdict and drop all charges against the rape victim. The woman, who is married, and an unrelated man were abducted and she was raped by a group of seven men more than a year ago. The male victim was also given an increased sentence of 200 lashes and six months in prison."
The man and woman were attacked after they met so she could retrieve an old photograph of herself from him. AlLahim said the man was trying to blackmail his client. It is illegal for a woman to meet with an unrelated male under Saudis Islamic law.
"AlLahim has been ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Justice next month. He faces a possible threeyear suspension and disbarment, according to Human Rights Watch. He said the handling of the case is a direct contradiction of judicial reforms announced by the Saudi king earlier this month. ""We will not accept this judgment and Ill do my best to continue representing her because justice needs to take place,"" he said."
"Under Saudi law, women are subject to numerous restrictions, including a strict dress code, a prohibition against driving and a requirement that they get a mans permission to travel or have surgery. Women are also not allowed to testify in court unless it is about a private matter that was not observed by a man. Human Rights Watch points out that a judge in Jeddah threw out a lawyer simply because he was a member of the Ismaili faith, a branch of Shia Islam."
"The Saudi government recently has taken some steps toward bettering the situation of women in the kingdom. Christoph Wilcke of Human Rights Watch praised the female rape victim and her attorney for speaking out about the case. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack called the case and the punishment surprising and astonishing. The Saudi government is fully behind punishing a woman whos been raped and punishing the lawyer who tried to help her, he says. And if they hadnt spoken to the media, we wouldnt know about it."
"Investigators seize computers and are analyzing information on Web sites. Most people would be quite astonished by the situation,  McCormack says. I cant get involved in specific court cases in Saudi Arabia dealing with its own citizens. But most people here would bequite surprised to learn of the circumstances and then the punishment meted out, says McCormack. The investigation into the deadly mall shooting in Omaha continues."
"Robert Hawkins also left a voice mail for his mother before killing eight people. Hawkins visited a friend near the Westroads Mall before the shootings. Police dont yet know why Hawkins chose the mall or the Von Maur department store in particular, police chief says. He chose his victims randomly, police believe, then took his own life."
" Hawkins left a suicide note and other correspondence, Warren said. Typically there are hints that something like this may take place, he said. If there is any justification, any explanation, police will find it, police said."
"A friend of Hawkins family who was letting him live in her home found the suicide note just minutes before the shootings. He basically said how sorry he was for everything, she told CNNs Anderson Cooper on Wednesday.Apparently he had been experiencing some mental health problems, ideations of suicide."
"Security officers flagged Hawkins as suspicious when he entered the mall. He left soon after he entered, then returned with something apparently hidden in a balledup sweatshirt. He went up an elevator to the malls third floor, then immediately began firing, ultimately turning the firearm on himself."
" Hawkins fired more than 30 rounds, the police chief said. The shootings sent panicked holiday shoppers fleeing for cover. It was just so loud, and then it was silence, said witness Jennifer Kramer."
"A friend of Hawkins said he hadnt thought Hawkins was capable of such violence. ""He was the one guy, you know, if people would be getting in a fight hed be trying to break it up,"" Shawn Saunders said."
"U.S. Army recruiters turned Hawkins down last summer when he tried to enlist, a source familiar with the situation said. Hawkins had been a ward of the state for nearly four years, but he did not specify in what capacity."
"Heineman ordered that flags throughout the state be lowered to halfstaff through Sunday. The dead include six store employees and two customers, ranging in age from 24 to 66. One store employee was in critical but stable condition Thursday."
"Westroads Mall remained closed Thursday, but the facility, including the Von Maur store, could reopen Friday. Jolie has been working to focus attention on problem of refugees in Iraq. There doesnt seem to be a real coherent plan to help them, said Jolie, speaking in an exclusive interview with CNNs Arwa Damon Thursday."
"A goodwill ambassador for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Jolie wants to help the agency be more active inside wartorn Iraq. SunniShiite sectarian violence in the country has sparked a displacement crisis that is considered the most significant in the Middle East since the 1948 creation of Israel."
"More than 4.2 million Iraqis have fled their homes. Many of the internally displaced live precarious lives amid conditions of squalor. How Iraq settles in the years to come is going to affect the entire Middle East, says Jolie. Its in our best interest to address a humanitarian crisis on this scale, she says. ""Displaced can lead to a lot of instability and aggression,"" she adds."
"Jolie has been working to help draw attention to the problem. She has called for governments to bolster their support of the U.N. The visit to Iraq is focusing on the problems of the internally displaced, 58 percent of whom are under age 12."
A top issue for the agency is getting better security. Jolie said it was crucial that the government prepare a plan to deal with refugees who return home from Syria and Jordan. She emphasizes the way in which these people are resettled will have broad implications in the region. The Iraqi government needs to empower agencies that deal with migration to address the concerns of the displaced.
"Jolie also is talking to people about moving forward the U.S. effort to resettle Iraqi refugees in the United States. Only 375 have been admitted so far. Most of the refugees are in Syria and Jordan, and they reside in big cities like Damascus and Amman. Money is being allocated to Iraq and host countries to help clothe, feed and house people."
"UNHCR is trying to help governments in Syria and Jordan to cope with the influx. It is also attempting to help 41,000 nonIraqi refugees in Iraq, such as Palestinians and Iranians. Last month, the UNHCR announced a plan to seek 261 million this year."
"Ezequiel Lavezzi scores twice as Napoli beat Udinese 3-1. Argentine also provided the cross that Cristian Zapata put into his own net. Napoli move up to ninth in Serie A, while Udinese remain in fifth place. Both teams had a player sent off in Saturday's match in Naples. The match took place in a country where mixed Shiite and Sunni neighborhoods have turned into Sunni or Shiite enclaves."
"Pepe leveled the score on nine minutes, and then Napoli played with 10 men from the 36th minute after Paolo Cannavaro was expelled for a lastman foul. Udinese are still four points behind fourthplaced Fiorentina and the last Champions League berth."
"Miccoli struck in the 76th minute with a shot from just outside the area with Livorno goalkeeper Marco Amelia partially unsighted by several players. Palermo keeper Alberto Fontana saved a penalty by Francesco Tavano at the end of the first half. Inter Milan host secondbottom Empoli and secondplaced Roma travel to thirdbottom Siena. Thirdplaced Juventus host bottom club Cagliari, Sampdoria travel to Lazio, Parma play Atalanta and Reggina face fellow strugglers Torino."
"As many as 28 in every 1,000 passengers do not arrive at their destination at the same time as their luggage. The trial  run by BAA and airline Emirates is using RFID radiofrequency identification technology to tag baggage. This will allow staff to more accurately track bags passing through the airport."
Barcode tags can be easily damaged in transit and are also at risk of being covered when scanned. BAA estimates that Heathrow can read only 60 per cent of labels that pass through. RFID is reported to offer over 99 percent accuracy.
A duplicate of the Heathrow system has been installed at Dubai Airport. Staff apply tags containing RFID chips to bags with information including the passengers name and route. The chips are then read on entry into the baggage system they are tracked as they move throughout and finally on leaving the system.
"Emirates and BAA are sharing the costs of the trial. The main benefits will be for travelers passing through major hubs such as Heathrow and Dubai. RFID could extend services to frequent flyers, and provide the means to added value services such as faster checkin, and even be integrated with secure collection and delivery. The idea will be to send passengers a text informing them what belt and what time their bags will arrive at."
"Hong Kong International Airport was one of the first to deploy RFID technology in 2005. RFID is being used in just 6 percent of the airports surveyed. For this system to really take off we need other airports and other airlines to embrace the technology, says Cowlam."
The SITA survey indicated that RFID tags will be used in 45 percent of airports by the end of 2009. There have been giant strides in the technology in aviation in recent years. This is a major step forward.
"Hussein sent secret message to President Nixon in 1970 pleading with him to attack Syria. Papers are among about 10,000 documents released by the Nixon Presidential Library. Some of the documents offer harbingers of presentday events, such as concerns about terrorism and Saudi Arabia. Library director Timothy Naftali said the documents describe challenges such as how to get the Saudis more involved in solving the PalestinianIsraeli conflict, how to address the Arab view that the United States always sides with Israel."
"Documents detail U.S. efforts to persuade Saudi Arabia to move away from Fatah, the military wing of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Officials believed the PLO was supporting the terrorist, antiIsrael group Black September, referred to as BSO. The Nixon White House also was adjusting to Israels acquisition of a nuclear weapon. The document release was intended to coincide with Mideast peace summit."
"We are declassifying the records that laid the basis for Richard Nixons decision in 1969 to accept the fact, a fact of life, that Israel had a bomb, a nuclear device, said Naftali. Rather than openly declare itself as a nuclear power, Israel still maintains a strategic ambiguity over its nuclear weapons capability."
"In 1970, as King Hussein dealt with threats by both Palestinian refugees in his country and Syrian military forces crossing Jordans border, the king asked the United States and Great Britain to intervene. Syria had invaded Jordan and the Jordanian king, facing what he felt was a military rout, said please help us in any way possible. The telegram indicates that Hussein himself called a U.S. official at 3 a.m. to ask for American or British help."
"Nixon served as president from January 20, 1969, to August 9, 1974. He resigned under political pressure during the Watergate scandal. He died in 1994 after suffering a stroke at the age of 81. The library has withheld the Nixon documents from public access until Wednesday."
"Orange was a native of Birmingham, Alabama. He was arrested and jailed in Perry County, Alabama, in 1965. His jailing sparked a fatal protest that ultimately led to the famed SelmatoMontgomery march and the Voting Rights Act. He died Saturday at Atlantas Crawford Long Hospital, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference says. He lived in southwest Atlanta for four decades while fighting the good fight for equality and social justice for all mankind."
"Witnesses said Jackson was trying to get his grandfather to the hospital. Jackson, 26, died eight days later. The anger resulting from Jacksons death led civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, to speak out."
"The first attempt at that march was broken up by clubwielding state troopers and sheriffs deputies. Jimmies death is the reason that Bloody Sunday took place, Orange said. Had he not died, there would never have been a Bloody Sunday."
"In May 2007, a former Alabama state trooper, James B. Fowler, now 74, was indicted in Jacksons shooting. Fowler has claimed he shot Jackson in selfdefense, but two witnesses disputed that claim. President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law in August 1965. The case is one of several involving the deaths of civil rights activists that prosecutors have revived in recent years."
"Orange was a project coordinator at the SCLC from 1965 to 1970. He later became a regional coordinator with the AFLCIO in Atlanta. Since 1995, he had served as the founder and general coordinator for the M.L. King Jr. March CommitteeAfricaAfrican American Renaissance Committee, Inc."
"Voters in Beirut sent progovernment candidate Mohammed alAmin Itani to parliament. Both Eido, a Sunni Muslim, and Itani are members of the bloc led by Saad Hariri. But in Metn, a Maronite Christian suburb east of the capital, antigovernment candidate Camille Khouri upset former President Amin Gemayel by a few hundred votes, Lebanese television network LBC reported."
"Khouri is a member of the Free Patriotic Movement, the antigovernment party led by former Lebanese Army Gen. Michel Aoun. Gemayel was seeking the seat held by his son Pierre, who served as industry minister in the government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora before being gunned down in his car in November 2006."
"Eido and Gemayel were among several Lebanese political figures killed since the February 2005 killing of the elder Hariri. All were critical of Syrias influence in Lebanon, and their supporters blamed Damascus for their deaths. Hariris killing triggered a wave of protests against Syria known as the Cedar Revolution, which brought Sinioras government to power."
ExCIA agent John Kiriakou says he underwent waterboarding in training and cracked in a few seconds. He spoke last week after the CIA disclosed that videotapes of certain interrogations were destroyed in 2005. That revelation has prompted new calls for investigations on Capitol Hill. The Bush administration appeared in U.S. District Court on Friday to answer questions about the tapes destruction.
Kiriakou says he was unaware that CIA interrogations were being taped. He says the tapes should have been kept as a matter of historical record. Kiriakou's attorney says the referral of the case to the Justice Department is standard procedure.
"A criminal referral from the CIA would be both expected and normal under the circumstances. Zaid added that the question is whether the Justice Department will proceed, and that such a decision must be measured carefully. There would also exist a challenge regarding whether Mr. Kiriakou was being targeted for exercising his First Amendment rights."
"CIA officers who leave the agency are required to sign documents promising never to divulge classified information. Written comments are cleared by an agency review board before publication. Unscripted oral comments  such as television interviews are referred to the Justice Department after the fact. An investigation could take months to complete, a source in the intelligence community said."
"Kiriakou says he was not present when other agents used the waterboarding technique on Abu Zubayda. Kiriakou said he himself was subjected to the treatment during his training, and lasted about five seconds before having to stop."
"Four years ago, Felicia Sullivan whispered in her live-in boyfriend's ear that he was the one for her. Sullivan, 32, who works in marketing, says she's glad to know he's the one."
"Aghast at his response, Sullivan quickly broke things off  but she couldnt move until she found a new apartment. She decided to snoop through her exboyfriends email and discovered hed had contact with several other women while they were together."
"Ive never been a big fan of the holiday, Sullivan says. But now I typically refer to it as Black Monday. Sullivan isnt alone in dreading Valentines Day. February 14 has gone from a sentimental aside to a pressurefilled gauntlet."
"The holidays designed to make you feel bad, says Judy McGuire, author of How Not to Date. I think people should lower Valentines Day expectations to pretty much nil. That way, anything that happens is good."
"Brian Wise, a 32-year-old technical writer from Seattle has seen his Valentines Day go sideways repeatedly. Wise talked his way out of an arrest luckily, one of the policemen had eaten at the same place but hes found no release from his unlucky Valentines. He says he met this beautiful woman who took him to dinner at this hot, new restaurant, he says. But then she gets food poisoning and ends up in an alley with major gastrointestinal problems."
"Most women will admit they like to celebrate, but a fancy night on the town isnt necessary. Sometimes, hanging out at home can be a lot more fun than going out to some restaurant filled with couples."
"Stay home with champagne, caviar and maybe a new toy from a tasteful sex shop. If youre not dating anyone, take some time to indulge yourself a luxurious bar of chocolate, a pedicure, do something relaxing take a yoga class or get a massage. Make sure youre on the same page. And if you do make plans, stick to them."
"Galen's boyfriend wanted to go out with his friends on the big night. But his friends talked him into going out with them instead. ""I was dressed to the nines,"" says Galen, who asked that her last name not be used. ""He picked up his coat and left"""
"The two later broke up. To avoid a disconnect with your significant other, McGuire suggests being honest. McGuire recommends not settling for a cliché like a stuffed animal or a hastily purchased bouquet of flowers."
"Listen to what the person talks about, says Katie Briggs, 44, of Seattle. She may want the newGodzilla game for her Wii. His underwear may be riddled with holes."
"Briggs gave her date homemade cookies and a Starbucks gift card. He gave her a beautifullywrapped box  of Spam. He thought it was the best joke ever, says Briggs."
"Attorneys for terror suspect say he was tortured while being held at secret prisons. They want judge to bar CIA from destroying evidence of alleged torture. One of 14 highvalue detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, alleges he was Tortured."
"Majid Khan is a native of Pakistan who attended high school in Baltimore. Khan was held for more than three years at the secret CIA prisons. Khans attorneys say he suffers severe physical and psychological trauma from which he is unlikely ever to recover fully as a result of his ordeal. CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano told CNN, CIAs terrorist interrogation effort has always been small, carefully run, lawful and highly productive. The motion was filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights attorneys on behalf of Majid Khan."
"Khans attorneys claim he was taken into custody in 2003 and forcibly disappeared before his transfer to Guantanamo. He filed a legal challenge to his detention in September 2006 and appeared before a Combatant Status Review Tribunal in April. He was found to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant, but filed a challenge to that on August 14."
"The Bush administration contends Khan was an operative working for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. Khan researched how to blow up gas stations and poison reservoirs in the U.S., the administration has said. He is among 14 highvalue detainees held at Guantanamo. He has been on hunger strikes while in Guantanamo, and suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder."
"In detention, he has been able to communicate with Abu Zubayda, the notes say. Zubyda was one of the two al Qaeda suspects whose interrogations were videotaped. Without a court order requiring the preservation of evidence, there is substantial risk that the torture evidence will disappear, attorneys claim. The motion was filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit."
"Hayden has said the CIA stopped videotaping in 2002, while Khan was not taken into custody until the following year. City officials in New York have denied Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejads request to visit the site of the destroyed World Trade Center. The information developed by the detention and interrogation program has been irreplaceable, and the program has operated in strict accord with American law."
"Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad asked to visit ground zero. But workers are rebuilding the foundations of the site, and it would not be possible for him to go. Iranian officials have not put in any additional requests to visit the public platforms at ground zero, police spokesman Paul Browne says. But, he says, If there were a further request, wed reject it because of security fears."
"Ahmadinejads predecessor at the time of the September 11 attacks, Mohammed Khatami, condemned them. Iran is ruled by a Shiite Muslim government hostile to the fundamentalist Sunni al Qaeda. The United States and Iran have not had formal diplomatic relations since 1980 after Iranian militants stormed the United States Embassy in Tehran and held Americans hostage for 444 days."
"The United States considers Iran a state sponsor of terrorism. It has accused the country of meddling in Iraq and in Afghanistan. More than 2,700 people died in the attack on the World Trade Center, when al Qaeda terrorists flew hijacked passenger jets into the twin towers. A third jet hit the Pentagon, and a fourth crashed in a Pennsylvania field after passengers resisted their hijackers."
"Hillary Clinton, the New York senator and Democratic frontrunner, called the request unacceptable. Mitt Romney, a leading Republican, called it shockingly audacious. Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani said under no circumstances should Ahmadinejad be allowed to visit the World Trade Center site. Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said the site should not be used as a photo op."
Lisa Nowak is accused of using pepper spray against a romantic rival. A Florida judge ruled evidence found in her car and statements she made to police after her arrest were inadmissible at trial. Washington accuses Tehran of trying to produce a nuclear bomb. Iran insists it is producing nuclear fuel for civilian power plants.
"Lisa Nowak, 44, is accused of stalking Air Force Capt. Colleen Shipman and using pepper spray against her in a parking lot at Orlando International Airport in Florida on February 5. No written consent was obtained to search her car, Lubet wrote in his opinion. ""This court must ensure that the constitutional protections afforded by our forefathers are scrupulously honored,"" he said."
"She pleaded not guilty March 22 to charges of attempted kidnapping with intent to inflict bodily harm, battery and burglary of a vehicle using a weapon. If convicted, she would face a sentence of up to life in prison. Her defense attorneys had claimed Nowaks comments to police and her consent to search her car were made under duress."
"Lubet said in his ruling that when Nowak asked Becton if she needed an attorney during the interview, he failed to answer her question in a simple and straightforward manner. There was a concerted effort to minimize and downplay the significance of the Miranda rights by referring to these constitutional rights asformalities, Lubet wrote. There is nothing in either the audio recording or the transcript of the interview that demonstrates that defendant understood these two rights and waived them."
"Becton used legally impermissible statements and techniques, including threats, to get Nowaks statements and consent, Lubet says. Orlando Police Department spokeswoman says it is inappropriate for the department to comment on the case since it is pending in court. Lubet notes that, although Nowak was given the opportunity to use the restroom and was asked if she wanted something to eat, she was subjected to a barrage of questions."
"Defendant had not slept during the preceding 24 hours, the judge said. Nowaks consent to search her car, Lubet wrote, followed illegal police activity. Prosecutors accuse Nowak of driving nearly 900 miles from Houston to Orlando  wearing NASA diapers. Her attorney has strongly denied that she wore the diapers."
"Police said Nowak was detained as she was disposing of her disguise in an airport trash bin. Nowak has said she merely went to the airport to talk to Shipman, who had begun dating Nowaks former love interest, Navy Cmdr. Bill Oefelein, who was also an astronaut but has since left the astronaut corps."
"He also testified he found used and clean diapers in the car. Police previously said they also found a BB gun, a steel mallet, a 4inch knife and rubber tubing in the vehicle. Nowaks attorneys in August filed a notice of intent to rely on an insanity defense."
"Sharon Long is a forensic artist whose job is to help identify the dead, often murder victims. Armed with sculptors clay, glass eyes, wigs and research, Long creates a face from a human skull. When Fort Myers, Florida, police found eight sets of human remains in the woods in March, they turned to her."
"She hopes that when the faces of those killed get printed in newspapers or appear on TV or online, a friend or loved one recognizes them and says, Gee, we havent seen soandso for a while, and that kind of looks like him."
"Long, 67, has made faces for the unknown victims of grisly homicides and solved historical mysteries. She helped identify the crew of the H.L Hunley, a Confederate submarine sunk during the Civil War. She also created the first picture of the only explorer to have died on the Lewis and Clark expedition."
"Eight men were found dead in a wooded area in Fort Myers, Florida, in 2007. There were no witnesses, no leads and little evidence of killings other than the victims bones. If Long could identify the victims of the crime, it might help to catch a serial killer."
Long first creates a mold of the skull and uses it to make a plaster replica. Sculptors clay fills in for skin and muscle. The faded gumline on the skulls teeth helps Long determine how thick the persons lips were.
"The victims hair and eye color requires guesswork and research, Long says. Often while working on cases, she talks to people who lived in the same area as the victim or victims to find out the most common eye color. She spent two months on the Fort Myers skulls."
"Erik Kohler and John Blevins lived hardscrabble lives and had runins with police. Eventually, publicity about the Fort Myers case would lead people with missing relatives to submit their DNA."
"Police hope people with missing relatives will look at every detail of the other six sculptures to see whether they notice any resemblance, no matter how faint. Kohler and Blevins didnt closely mirror Longs sculptures of their faces, but there were some similarities, some facial features that looked like the two dead men. Fort Myers Police Detective Barry Lewis: I am just looking for that one little similarity, that onelittle key that someone could recognize."
"Since the news conference, police say, they have received hundreds of leads. Longs work on the case might be done, but she still has nightmares about the eight men killed. I can see somebody dragging a body out there, and here he kept taking them to the same area, she said."
Zookeepers in Nuremberg will bottlefeed a fourweekold polar bear and rear it away from its mother. Six of those killed remain nameless. Police are still trying to find the killer.
"The cub, which doesnt yet have a name, was being cared for at Nuremberg City Zoo. Its gaining weight, its very hungry, it drinks a lot of milk, said Alexandra Foghammar, a spokeswoman for the city. Wednesday, the zoo said keepers decided to take the cub away from its mother, Vera."
"The cub is thriving in the care of humans, but Vera seems to miss her cub, Foghammar said. The zoo confirmed earlier this week that its other female polar bear, Vilma, had eaten her two offspring."
"Zookeepers are pondering whether to bring another adult bear, possibly the cubs father, Felix, to the zoo to help Vera overcome her loss. The zoo said a keeper entered Vilmas enclosure Monday and noticed that her two cubs were nowhere to be found."
"The zoo said it assumes Vilma ate her young because she believed the cubs were sick. But Foghammar said the separation of the bears was bad for the principle of wildlife conservation at the zoo. Now the cub will not grow up to act in a natural way, just as the mother lacked the experience to bring up a cub. The plight of the cub follows the case last year of Knut, a cub rejected by its mother at Berlin Zoo."
"The four of them met and hugged and cried, said Boyd, the senior pastor at New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Boyd was referring to a meeting on January 3 between Ron and Loretta Murray and David and Marie Works, whose daughters were killed in the rampage. David Works also was wounded in the shootings."
"The pastor said he invited the Murrays to visit the New Life campus after praying over the holidays. The family was given a guided stepbystep tour of where the rampage took place. At one point, the parents also met with security guard Jeanne Assam, who shot their son in the leg."
"The parents thanked Assam for her swift action and for helping save more lives. They told Assam that they were so deeply sorry she had to do what she did, a friend says. There were tears, lots of embraces, prayers, she says. The visit was important in the healing process for the Murrays."
"Ive never seen repentance and forgiveness as profound as I did that day. This kid was raised in an upper middleclass home and had every chance to do well, Boyd said. The Murrays met the Works in Boyds office."
"The pastor said he didnt tell many people about the meeting before it happened, fearing it could have gotten volatile and hostile. On Sunday, he began his sermon by telling his congregation about what had transpired just a few days earlier."
"The Murrays visited the mission center December 12 and met with the families of the slain victims. Matthew Murray began his assault that day at the Youth With a Mission center in Arvada, Colorado. He killed two people  Tiffany Johnson, 26, and Philip Crouse, 24. He wounded two others before he went to the New Life Church, about 80 miles away."
"13 wildfires have consumed more than 98,000 acres and destroyed or damaged at least 50 homes and businesses. More than 265,000 people have been evacuated and nearly 4,900 firefighters are battling the blazes. The winds driving the flames are expected to stay strong, coming out of the northeast, at least through Tuesday, says CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano. The fires began over the weekend."
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declares state of emergency in seven counties. Schwarzenegger asks U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates to order delivery of all available Modular Airborne Fire Fighting Systems MAFFS to help fight the fires.
"Citing the proliferation in the number of fires, Schwarzenegger wrote. The federal Agriculture Department will provide fire crews, air tankers and helicopters. The state will receive assistance grants to help pay firefighting costs. One person was killed and 18 were reported injured in the county, including five firefighters."
"Local officials said the fire situation had worsened throughout the day. Five of six homes in Rancho Bernardo burned to the ground, according to a KGTV report. ""We have some of the highest temperatures,"" a county official says. ""All the ingredients for a perfect firestorm"""
"Officials turn Qualcomm Stadium, home of the NFLs San Diego Chargers, into an evacuation center. Residents of four housing areas at the Camp Pendleton Marine base were put on notice for possible evacuations. Fires threatened the San Diego Zoos Wild Animal Park on Monday, causing the park to close. Some of the animals, such as endangered condors, are being moved to a safer location."
"The largest of the wildfires is the Buckweed blaze north of Los Angeles. It has consumed 27,500 acres and forced the evacuation of 15,000 residents. Authorities are asking people to hold off on 911 calls unless there is a real emergency. Two fires that erupted Monday morning near Lake Arrowhead have destroyed at least 123 structures and charred 1,800 acres, a spokeswoman says."
"Nearly 1,450 firefighters are battling the blaze in Malibu Canyon. The Canyon fire is only 10 percent contained, an official says. The Pacific Coast Highway remains shut down in the area. The fire is still threatening 900 structures, the state forestry department says."
"Glasgow derby between Celtic and Rangers has been postponed as a mark of respect following the death of Motherwell captain Phil ODonnell. SPL secretary Iain Blair said: ""These are never easy decisions. But we recognise that as a former player, Phil was part of Celtics extended football family"""
"Motherwells game against Hibernian on the same day was called off on Saturday night in the hours after ODonnell, 35, died following his onfield collapse. Gretnas match against St Mirren was also postponed as it was scheduled to take place at Fir Park which has become a shrine to the memory of ODonnell. The SPL confirmed that the other three fixtures scheduled for Wednesday will go ahead."
"Motherwells home game against Celtic next Sunday had already been postponed by the SPL. Long distances over questionable roads stop many Indians from making it into courtrooms. In a nation of more than a billion people and millions of unresolved court cases, how do you take care of the backlog?"
"Judge Sandeep Singh's courtroom is a desk plopped down in the middle of a dusty schoolyard. It works like any other regular court, Singh said."
"The mobile court is bused into rural areas to hear both criminal and civil complaints. With an estimated 300 million unresolved cases languishing in Indian courts, it could take more than 300 years to clear the docket at the current pace. People often have to travel long distances over questionable roads, using slow modes of transportation."
"The mobile court claims to be both fast and efficient. Singh said he has been able to clear 1,100 cases in just six months time compared to 500 under the traditional court system. With distance no longer a problem, more villagers and their attorneys are coming to hearings."
"Fran Townsend turned in her letter of resignation to President Bush on November 6. Townsend: Im going to just take another job doing 20hour days, but this time in the private sector. Townsend has spent 25 years working in law enforcement and government. Bush praised Townsends work Monday."
"Townsend's job involved identifying terrorist groups around the globe and assessing their threat. She said that experience should will be useful in the private sector as well. Townsend said she first will look into public speaking, writing and board work before pursuing opportunities in global risk management for a large multinational corporation or financial institution."
Townsend's name had come up during the presidents recent search for a new attorney general. She said not getting the job had absolutely nothing to do with her decision to leave. Townsend said Bush had wanted her to stay on in his administration.
" Townsend is part of the search committee to find a replacement by the beginning of next year. The president appoints the senior staff position, and it needs no Senate confirmation. ""I have loved and will cherish my every minute of service,"" she says."
"Lawsuit filed on behalf of nearly 400 Colombian families. Plaintiffs are seeking damages for terrorism, war crimes... and wrongful death. Chiquita, as part of a plea agreement, admitted that what it called protection payments had been given to Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia. The plaintiffs are asking for 10 million in compensatory damages for each of the 393 victims."
"AUC was named a terrorist organization by the United States in 2002. The lawsuit alleges Chiquitas interaction with the paramilitary group went further than the payments. It accuses the company of facilitating shipments of arms to the group. They conspired with the AUC, aided and abetted them in a farreaching conspiracy, the suit says. The families filing the suit will remain anonymous because of fear of reprisals."
"The principle upon which this lawsuit is brought is that when you put money into the hands of terrorists, then you are legally responsible for the atrocities, the murders and the tortures that those terrorists commit, Reiter said. Chiquita Brands International categorically denies the allegations made by these attorneys. The company said it had been forced to make protection payments to safeguard our workforce. It is absolutely untrue for anyone to suggest that these payments were made for any other purpose."
"Mitchell said the company will fight the allegations. Chiquita has already been the victim of extortion in Colombia. We will not allow ourselves to become extortion victims in the United States, he said. In the March plea agreement, the company agreed to pay a 25 million fine for the payments."
"Riley Ann Sawyers was beaten with belts, picked up by her hair, thrown across the room and held under water, according to an affidavit from the Galveston County Sheriffs Office. The affidavit says the girls mother, Kimberly Dawn Trenor, described to police how her daughter died and was put in a plastic storage box. The body of the thenunidentified toddler was found on October 29."
"A fisherman found Rileys body stuffed inside a blue storage container that washed up on an uninhabited island in Galvestons West Bay. A medical examiner said the childs skull was fractured, and a forensic dentist estimated her age at 2 to 3 years. Police dubbed the child Baby Grace."
"Trenor gave a voluntary statement on video with her attorney present in which she describes her involvement, with Royce Zeigler, in the physical abuse, death and disposal of her daughter, Riley Ann Sawyers. Trenors statement said on July 24, she andZeigler both beat the child with leather belts and held her head under water in the bathtub. After her daughter died, Trenor said, they went to WalMart that night and bought the Sterilite container, a shovel, concrete mix, and other supplies."
"The box containing the childs body was hidden in a storage shed for one to two months. Then, Trenor said, she and Zeigler carried it to the Galveston Causeway and tossed it in. Riley Anns father, Robert Sawyers, on Monday tearfully remembered her as a funloving girl... with a big imagination."
"Authorities are fairly confident that the toddler whose body was found on October 29 is Riley Ann Sawyers. DNA analysis is still in progress to confirm the identification. The family was devastated to learn that police believe Riley is dead. Its hard to think that Ill never see her again, she said, clutching a red Elmo doll she had planned to give Riley for Christmas."
"Riley is originally from Mentor, Ohio, a Cleveland suburb. She and her mother came down to Texas earlier this year. The toddler was last seen in Texas three or four months ago, Tuttoilmondo says. The results will be available in two to three weeks, he says."
"The affidavit said Trenor admitted that after the body was found, Zeigler had her type up a fake letter from the Ohio Department of Childrens Services saying that Riley was to be taken away. She left Ohio in late May, after filing an allegation of domestic violence against Robert Sawyers and reaching a joint voluntary agreement that gave her custody of Riley."
"Riley Sawyers was the product of a teenage pregnancy. Trenor and Robert Sawyers were together for two years as a result of the pregnancy. The girls family in Ohio has been very helpful in this case, Tuttoilmondo said. The FBI and a Galveston County police officer visited the family on Sunday."
"DePledge said Monday that the family, whose grief she described as simply overwhelming, wants Rileys body returned to Ohio for a memorial service. ""I think this family needs some closure. What Riley needs is to be brought home,"" she said."
"He held up a small, pinkandwhite shoe identical to those the child was wearing when she was found. ""Any way you look at it, we carry a piece of her with us, and well always carry a little piece of hers with us,"" he said."
A second car packed with gas and nails was later found to have been parked just a few hundred yards from the first. The second car was towed away by traffic wardens in the early hours of Friday for violating parking restrictions. Police say two vehicles clearly linked. Four men are alleged to have attempted to carry out a second wave of attacks against Londons transport network.
"July 7, 2005 Four suicide bombers detonate themselves aboard three underground trains and a bus in a morning rush hour attack against Londons transport network. Seven men are convicted in May 2007 and sentenced to up to 26 years in prison. March 2001 A car bomb explodes outside the BBCs London headquarters, wounding one man."
"Police blame the Real IRA, a republican splinter group opposed to the IRAs cease fire. April 1999 Three people die when a nail bomb explodes in the Admiral Duncan pub in Londons gay district. A 23yearold selfdeclared Nazi, David Copeland, is sentenced to six life terms. June 1996 A massive IRA bomb exploded in a shopping center in central Manchester, injuring more than 200 people."
"April 1993 An IRA truck bomb devastates part of Londons financial district, killing one and wounding 44. Two boys aged three and 12 are killed and dozens are injured by two bombs left in litter bins in Warrington, northern England."
"Libyan agent Abdel Basset alMegrahi, convicted of the attack in 2001, was this week granted the right to mount a fresh appeal. September 1989 Eleven people die and 22 are wounded when an IRA bomb explodes at a Royal Marine music school in Deal, southern England. December 1988 A Pan Am airliner explodes over the Scottish town of Lockerbie, killing 259 aboard and 11 people on the ground."
"Topps Meat Co. expands recall of ground beef from about 300,000 pounds to 21.7 million pounds. Recall is one of the largest meat recalls in U.S. history. The recalled products are all ground beef patties with various brand names. In 1982 two IRA bomb attacks on soldiers in Londons parks kill 11 people and wound 50."
"25 illnesses are under investigation. The hamburger patties may be contaminated with E. coli O157H7. The ground beef products being recalled have a sell by date or a best if used by date between September 25, 2007, and Sept. 25, 2008. The packages also have the marking Est."
"Topps recalls about 331,000 pounds of hamburger meat. The meat was found to be inside the USDA mark of inspection. Topps is continuing to work with the USDA, state departments of health, retailers and distributors to ensure the safety of our consumers."
"Topps set up a tollfree recall help line at 888 7340451. Consumers who find the products at home are asked to cut off the UPC code and return it to Topps for a full refund. To avoid E. coli, consumers should wash hands thoroughly after handling the beef."
"Production in the ground beef area of the plant in Elizabeth has been shut down until all the investigations are complete. The products, all ground beef patties and hamburgers with various brand names, were distributed mainly in the northeastern United States, but went to retailers in many other areas of the country as well. While the sheer size of the recall is large, two other companies have been involved in larger recalls."
"A boy playing with matches started a Southern California wildfire. The Buckweed Fire scorched more than 38,000 acres. The fire destroyed 21 homes on its rampage. In 2002, Pilgrims Pride recalled more than 27 million pounds of poultry, and Hudson Foods recalled 25 millionpound of ground beef in 1997. The investigation led to a juvenile suspect, a sheriff's deputy says."
"After talking with that juvenile, he admitted to playing with matches, and accidentally starting the fire. The case will be presented to the Los Angeles County district attorney for possible charges. According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the Buckweed Fire burned 38,526 acres."
"Sixtythree structures, 21 of them homes, were destroyed, and three civilians and two firefighters were injured. The sheriffs department said the fire forced the evacuation of about 15,000 people. The fires are blamed for 14 deaths and charred more than 508,000 acres."
"Authorities are following 1,700 tips about a white Ford F150 pickup seen near the origin of the Santiago Fire in Orange County. Witnesses reported seeing the 19982004 model truck with chrome tubular running boards on Santiago Canyon Road on October 21. Authorities said last week they had found evidence at the scene, although they declined to describe it."
"A new CNNOpinion Research Corp. poll suggests the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination is a statistical dead heat in Texas. 50 percent of likely Democratic primary voters support Clinton as their choice for the partys nominee, with 48 percent backing Obama."
"The race is a virtual tie, taking into account the polls sampling error of plus or minus 4½ percentage points for Democratic respondents. One reason the race appears to be tight is that Texas Democrats are having a hard time choosing between two attractive options. Likely Democratic primary voters would be equally happy if either candidate won the nomination."
Roughly a quarter of likely voters say they could change their minds in the next two weeks. Many political strategists and analysts consider Texas and Ohio  which also holds a March 4 primary  mustwin states for Clinton. Obama has won the past eight contests and is now ahead in the overall battle for delegates.
Thirtytwo percent back former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and 11 percent support homestate congressman and former Libertarian standardbearer Ron Paul. The CNNOpinion Research Corp. poll was conducted by telephone from Friday through Sunday.
"McCain is the overwhelming frontrunner in the fight for the Republican presidential nomination. The poll was released on the same day the only living former Republican president George Herbert Walker Bush, the current presidents father  endorsed McCain at an event in Houston."
"McCain is picking up a bare majority among conservative likely voters in the GOP primary. A McCain victory in Texas would not be based on the votes of moderates and independents. Texas Democrats and Republicans may not see eye to eye on the issues, but the poll suggests they do agree on whats the most important issue."
"Thirty-five percent of Democrats and an equal number of Republicans said the economy was the most important issue in their choice for president. Health care was second, followed by the war in Iraq at 22 percent, illegal immigration at 10 percent and terrorism at 7 percent. Sixty percent of Republicans say theyll definitely support the candidate they are now backing."
"Likely Democratic primary voters view Clinton and Obama on roughly equal terms. Seventynine percent say its likely Clinton can win the nomination 82 percent say the same about Obama. At least 200 people were evacuated from their homes after a tanker truck carrying 9,000 gallons of gasoline erupted early Wednesday in a northern Boston suburb."
"No serious injuries were reported in the Everett, Massachusetts, blast. One man said he narrowly escaped from his car before it exploded. The tanker overturned and caught fire at a traffic circle in the town of about 37,000 outside Boston. It was carrying 9,000 gallons of gas."
"Officials are investigating whether the driver was speeding. Flames from the truck engulfed at least 40 cars and three buildings, two of them houses. The truck was destroyed, but the driver wasn't seriously injured, fire officials said. The cause of the fire is under investigation."
"The driver is identified as Chad LaFrance of Dover, New Hampshire. Evacuees were taken to an armory converted into a shelter, a Red Cross official says. Local streets were closed temporarily, and a nearby school was shut down for the day."
"Nearby resident Chris Barrow awoke to the sound of a big bang. At first, he thought it was a car accident, but when he went outside to investigate the noise, he saw fire. Barrow tried to escape in his car, but fire quickly surrounded the vehicle."
"I rode over the fire and my car caught fire, he told WCVB. I got out just in time, and I ran a couple feet just before it blew up. Despite the obvious claims of younger rivals Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, few can really argue with the 96 football journalists."
Kaka won the Ballon dOr for his performance in the Champions League final. AC Milan defeated Liverpool 2-1 in Athens to win the trophy. The 25-year-old Brazilian was born into a middle class family in Brasilia. He moved to the San Siro from Sao Paulo for a fee of just 8.5 million in the summer of 2003. Click here for all the latest from the 2014 Ballon D'Or ceremony in Paris.
Kaka was signed by Sao Paulo when he was just eight years old. He made his first team debut as an 18-year-old. A year later he was on his way to Milan where he won the Scudetto and the European Super Cup. In 2002 he was named in Felipe Scolari's 23man squad for the World Cup finals. He played only 19 minutes of the tournament in a group match against Costa Rica.
"Kaka is a goalscoring midfielder for Milan and Brazil. Carlo Ancelotti plays Kaka behind a main target man in a 4411 system. With Andrea Pirlo and Gennaro Gattuso holding the central midfield area, Kaka has a license to roam in behind the lone striker. And Kaka does this with devastating effect, running at the opposition with pace and power."
Interpol appeal for help to identify a man from digitally reconstructed photos taken from the Internet. Milan are floundering in Serie A and face the unthinkable prospect of not qualifying for next seasons competition unless they win the trophy. Real Madrid have coveted Kaka for the last two years and expect the world transfer record to be smashed if Milan dont secure a place among Europes elite.
"The pictures have been on the the Internet for several years, but investigators have been unable to determine the mans identity or nationality. Interpol has determined the photos were taken in Vietnam and Cambodia. Without the publics help this sexual predator could continue to rape and sexually abuse young children whose ages appear to range from six to early teens, says Interpol Secretary General Ronald K. Noble."
"Up to 80,000 items at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library are unaccounted for. Audit found significant breakdown in internal controls at the Reagan Library. The suspects photo and more information can be seen online at Interpols Web site. The decision to make public this mans picture was not one which was taken lightly, said Kristin Kvigne, assistant director of InterPols Trafficking in Human Beings Unit."
Inspector General Paul Brachfield says a significant breakdown in internal controls was found. The audit results prompted the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation to urge the National Archives to move quickly to fix the problems. The chairman of the board of trustees has contacted Weinstein to express the serious concerns and disappointment on behalf of the Reagan Foundation and Mrs. Reagan.
"Library officials told auditors that the collection contained approximately 100,000 items, yet the library systems only had information to locate and account for approximately 20,000. This does not automatically mean the approximately 80,000 remaining items are missing. The vast majority may very well be safely located within the librarys storage facilities."
"Although Congress has a copy of the audit, it has not yet been made public. The count of 100,000 was an estimate taken from the original Reagan White House Gift Unit database. Like all of the presidential libraries, the Reagan library stores their gifts in a locked vault, which is protected by a security camera. The Reagan library has already begun implementing recommendations from the audit."
"The Rice fire, east of Camp Pendleton, caused the evacuation of the Fallbrook community. 12 Defense Department firefighting teams, with 12 engines, are already working the blazes. More than 17,000 National Guardsmen are potentially available if needed. The audit examined management of artifacts at the Reagan library, Franklin D. Roosevelt library, John F. Kennedy library and Gerald R. Ford library."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger has already called up 1,500 National Guard troops. 550 Marines from Camp Pendleton are preparing to deploy to the fire area. All of the aid that we provide is the result of a request... from the state, McHale said. ""We have been very proactive in independently preparing those capabilities for the possibility of such requests,"" McHale added."
Sailors stationed in Southern California are abandoning their barracks. Orders have been given to all sailors ashore in barracks to move to shipboard billeting. The Pentagon provided 11 helicopters equipped with water buckets to fight the fires. Aerial attacks on the fires have been minimal because of high Santa Ana winds with gusts approaching 70 mph.
"Only essential personnel are requested to report to duty at San Diego, Coronado and El Centro bases. Those bases have also set up cots and tents for evacuees. The Navy has offered an Aegis cruiser, a guided missile destroyer, and two fast frigates to support evacuation efforts. March Air Reserve Base is the primary staging area for medical and relief supplies."
"The fires are also having a direct effect on military personnel. 1,400 Navy personnel and their families have been forced to evacuate. Camp Pendleton ordered 3,000 Marines to evacuate because of the fire. In all, the military has about 20 facilities around the San Diego area.  Tom Cruise expounds on his beliefs in Scientology in a 2004 video."
"The video was shown at a 2004 Scientology ceremony honoring Cruise for his humanitarian work. Church of Scientology officials said it can be viewed at any of its churches. The video has since been taken off YouTube, but an interview portion remained available on the celebrity Web site gawker.com on Thursday."
"Cruise Indoctrination Video Scientology Tried To Suppress is the title of gawker.com's presentation. It shows Tom Cruise, with all the wideeyed fervor that he brings to the promotion of a movie."
"Cruise talks over a repetitive guitarriff soundtrack, and appears to be answering questions. Publisher denies leaking other parts of the video to the Web. Cruise salutes a portrait of L. Ron Hubbard, cited on the churchs Web site as the founder of the only major religion founded in the 20th century. The publisher cites his accomplishments as everything from mariner and horticulturalist to author and humanitarian."
Cruise: A Scientologist has the ability to create new realities and improve conditions. The Church of Scientology highlights its humanitarian work. The Web site defines Scientology as the study of truth.
"The more you know as a Scientologist, you dont become overwhelmed by it, Cruise says. The unauthorized biography of Cruise is by author Andrew Morton. A Cruise spokesperson and the Church of Scientology have disputed the book."
"Accuracy and truth were not on Mortons agenda, according to a church statement. Morton denies that and says Cruise, who he calls a towering figure on the international scene, and his faith are worthy of scrutiny. If it wasnt for him the Church of Scientology would be a shadow of what it is today."
"Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd meets with Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Rudd says Australian commitment to Afghanistan is strong. French President Nicolas Sarkozy also meets with Karzai in Kabul. Sarkozy assures Karzai of his governments long term political and military support with the people of Afghanistan, according to a statement from the Afghan presidents office. The two leaders also visit their respective countrys troops participating in the NATOled International Security Assistance Force."
"We will be, as I said before, in this country, Afghanistan, for the long haul. Its important for us to be here in partnership with NATO countries, Rudd said. Australia's new defense minister warned U.S. and NATO allies that they risk losing the war in Afghanistan without a sharp shift in military and reconstruction efforts."
"Karzai thanks Australia, France and other countries for their help and support. More than 1,900 French troops are in Afghanistan, serving both the ISAF and the U.Sled Operation Enduring Freedom. Australia is the largest nonNATO contributor to the war in Afghanistan with nearly 1,000 troops stationed mostly in the southern province of Oruzgan. More work needs to be done to win the hearts and minds of the people of Afghanistan."
"Rudd made a surprise visit Friday to Iraq, where he promised continued Australian aid. Rudd had said he would start a phased withdrawal of Australian forces from Iraq if his Labor Party won the vote. Michael Vick turned himself in to authorities on Monday to get a head start on serving his sentence for running a dogfighting ring, the U.S. government said."
"The Atlanta Falcons quarterback is scheduled to be sentenced on December 10. Vick, 27, voluntarily turned himself in around noon. The quarterback, who has been suspended indefinitely by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, faces 12 to 18 months in prison on the charge. Vick pleaded guilty in August after three associates admitted their own roles in the operation and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors."
"Vick has apologized to everyone who has been hurt in this matter. CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin speculated that Vick started his sentence early to get it out of the way. On September 25, a Virginia grand jury indicted Vick and the three codefendants on state charges of running a dogfighting ring at Vicks home outside Newport News. Watch Toobin explain why Vick would surrender early here on CNN."
"The Surry County grand jury brought two charges against the four men one count of unlawfully torturing and killing dogs and one of promoting dogfights. Each is a felony charge that could result in a fiveyear prison term. In September, Vick was put under tight restrictions by the federal court after he tested positive for marijuana use."
"Vick tested positive for the drug on September 13, a court document from the Eastern District of Virginia shows. U.S. District Judge Henry E. Hudson ordered Vick to submit to any method of testing required. Those methods could include random drug testing, a remote alcohol testing system andor any form of prohibited substance screening or testing."
"Vick must participate in substance abuse therapy and mental health counseling if deemed advisable by the pretrial services officer or supervising officer at his own expense. Italian football has been tarnished in recent seasons by corruption, matchfixing scandals and crowd trouble. The sport of football can be a vehicle of education for the values of honesty, solidarity and fraternity, the pope said."
"The pope is reputedly a Bayern Munich supporter. In October, he was presented with a No. 16 shirt by officials of the lower league club Ancona. The club is currently second in Serie C1B, Italian footballs third tier league."
"Football should increasingly become a tool for the teaching of lifes ethical and spiritual values, the pope says. Pope Benedict XVIs predecessor, Pope John Paul II, was also a keen football fan, reportedly playing in goal during his youth in Poland. All Italian football matches were cancelled on the weekend following his death in 2005."

"Wife of ousted PM Thaksin Shinawatra arrives in Thailand to face corruption charges. She promises to fight the accusations, her attorney says. On an average day, the site says, 5,800 vehicles cross it."
"Pojamarn Shinawatra was presented with an arrest warrant shortly after arriving at Bangkoks Suvarnabhumi International Airport. Greeted by about 50 wellwishers, Pojamarn arrived at court accompanied by her three children. She faces charges stemming from a Bangkok land deal and a stock concealment plan."
"The court released her on 5 million baht about 168,000 bail and ordered her not to leave the country. He was deposed by a military junta in Sept. 2006 and fled to London. In Decembers parliamentary elections, supporters of Thaksin, the People Power Party, won nearly half the seats in the lower house."
Thaksin said he would not reenter politics when he returned to Thailand. He said that he and his family had suffered enough but that he wanted to face the charges against him and prove his innocence. Thaksin is a 58yearold telecommunications tycoon who owns the English Premier League Manchester City Football Club.
"Second night of lawlessness in Paris suburbs leaves scores of police injured. Angry mob repeatedly clashed with riot police and torched cars and buildings. Violence spread to nearby towns of Longjumeau and Grigby Monday night. Two teens on a motorcycle were killed following a collision with a police car Sunday night. The 15 and 16yearold boys, both sons of African immigrants, died when their motorbike hit a patrol car in VilliersleBel."
"Some residents, populated largely by immigrants and their Frenchborn children, accused police of fleeing the crash scene. Three eyewitnesses, interviewed on TV, said the police stayed and tried to revive the two boys with mouth to mouth resuscitation. More than 60 police officers were injured in Monday nights confrontation, with five kept in hospital in a serious condition."
"60 cars, a library and car dealers showroom have been set on fire in VilliersleBel. A police station had also been damaged and 15 garbage cans torched, police say. Security was tightened Tuesday, with helicopters deployed to patrol over the town. The town was not among the districts hit by weeks of nationwide rioting in November 2005."
Sarkozy urged residents Monday to cool down and let the justice system determine who is responsible for what. The prosecutors office in the nearby town of Pontoise has already begun an inquiry into the deaths. Police said the teens drove through a red light without wearing helmets and on an unregistered bike.
"The brother of one of the victims says the police involved should be arrested. The boys motorbike was driving at very high speed and failed to give priority to the police patrol vehicle. The police car was driving normally at around 40 kilometers an hour, the newspaper reported the watchdog had found."

Business leaders said that the government was losing around 2 billion Shillingings 29.5 million a day in lost revenue as a result of the political violence. ""We do seem to be in a new place, theres a lot of uncertainty about where we go from here,"" an analyst says."
"Kenya has attracted a large number of multinationals and is home to one of the worlds fastest growing stock exchanges. Its relative economic success has been helped in part by its thriving tourist sector. Provisional figures for 2006 from the Kenyas tourist board said the country had received 1.5 million visitors for the year, a growth of 5.2 per cent."
"British tourists already in the country have been advised by the British Foreign Office to stay indoors and to stay away from the major cities. There are also worries about the knockon effect for the region, since around 40 percent of Kenyas exports go to other African nations. Of even greater concern is the effect on Kenya's lucrative agriculture industry."

"The Democratic Party has stripped the state of its delegates for moving up its primary date so early. The struggling auto industry has been a drag on Michigans economy. In many ways, the Republican battle for Michigan will be similar to last weeks New Hampshire contest."
"Sen. John McCain won New Hampshire with the help of independent voters. In 2000, McCain defeated thenTexas Gov. George W. Bush in the Michigan primary. In that vote, more than half  52 percent  were either independents or Democrats."
"Among Republican voters, McCain lost to Bush 29 percent to 66 percent. Overall, Michigan is a swing state, producing narrow margins of victory for presidential candidates and statewide officeholders. However, voting trends favor the Democrats."
"The Democratic presidential nominee has carried Michigan in the last four elections. Sen. John Kerry, the Democrats 2004 standard bearer, won Michigan 51 percent to 48 percent over President Bush. Michigans unemployment rate, 7.4 percent, is higher than the national average of 5 percent."

Other GOP contenders, most notably former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, are capable figures with impressive resumes."
"Maria Lauterbach was eight months pregnant when she went missing on December 14. The 20-year-old Marine could give birth at any time, sheriff says. LautERbachs mother said that her daughter, of Montgomery, Ohio, had witnessed an incident at Camp Lejeune and was to testify about it."
"Sheriffs department officials said evidence causes them to be concerned about Lauterbachs disappearance. The Marines car was found Monday at Jacksonvilles bus station. Her cell phone had been found at Camp Lejeunes front gate on December 20. Her mother reported her missing on December 19, and told the sheriffs department that she was very suspicious that something bad may have happened to her daughter."
A Facebook page established to help find Lauterbach says she was last seen December 14 in Jacksonville. The mother became concerned when she did not hear from her daughter for five days. December 14 was also the last time Lautingbachs cell phone was used.

"The plight of Iraqs children is nearing epidemic proportions, he said. Mothers and fathers abandoning their children because theyre becoming a liability, he added. ""When I see the suffering of those people, that really shook me"""
"The Red Crescent has the monumental task of treating and feeding more than 1.6 million children under the age of 12 who have become homeless in their own country. When you become so desperate, you tend to just throw everything up and go, Hakki said."
"With 95,000 volunteers and 5,000 employees, the Iraqi Red Crescent is the last line of defense for the countrys poor, sick and displaced. They try to blend in as best they can, with Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds working in the neighborhoods distinct to their ethnicities."
"Eight have been wounded, including six left disabled by the severity of their wounds. Hakki says the spike in numbers of abandoned children is especially alarming. The majority of parents in Iraq, he says, leave their children with a single relative."
"An entire generation lacking basic life skills, surviving with no education, no income and no families. Children are becoming a liability for both the father and the mother. The trauma of whats happening to those children is enormous."
"If somebody is injured by a bullet or shrapnel, it takes a week or two and hes fine. The psychosocial injury is pretty deep and can take months, if not years to heal. The group gets some financial support from the central government. Its also negotiating with the U.S. Embassy to see if it can offer financial aid."
"CNN visited an Iraqi Red Crescent treatment center in Baghdads Mansour district. The group closed 18 camps for the winter and is trying to house those thousands of people in abandoned government buildings.

"Coalition forces found 26 bodies buried in mass graves and a torture complex. Chains hanging from walls and ceilings and a bed connected to an electrical system. Troops made the discovery while conducting an operation north of Muqdadiya, Iraq. From December 8 to 11, troops killed 24 people they said were terrorists and detained 37 suspects."
"The complex was in an area thought to be an al Qaeda in Iraq haven and operating base. Evidence of murder, torture and intimidation against local villagers was found throughout the area. The moves were part of an operation called Iron Reaper that has been in progress across northern Iraq."
26 bodies were uncovered in mass graves next to what were thought to be execution sites. The bodies are believed to have been dead between six and eight months. Some had their hands tied behind their backs.
"Identification is proving to be a challenge because of advanced decomposition. Photos given to the news media show a filthy bed wired to an electrical system. A short distance away from the complex, troops found a bulletriddled Iraqi police vehicle."
"Some of the bodies may belong to Iraqi police, according to military video. Operation netted nine weapons caches, which have been destroyed, military says. They included antiaircraft weapons, sniper rifles, more than 65 machine guns and pistols. Also found were mines, pipe bombs, rocketpropelled grenades, mortar tubes and rounds."
"Mohamed ElBaradei, the U.N. nuclear watchdog chief, fears for Pakistans nuclear weapons. Pakistan rejects the statement by Dr. El baradei. As head of the IAEA, he has to be careful about his statements which ought to remain within the parameters of his mandate."
"ElBaradei said that Pakistan's recent political instability makes it more sensitive to problems in other Muslim countries. Pakistan has been in a state of political upheaval since the countrys opposition challenged President Pervez Musharrafs tight grip on power. The effects of any new war in the Middle East and the Islamic world could have repercussions, not only in Iran, but what I fear most is the effect in Pakistan, a nation with many internal problems."
"The country further spiraled into chaos after the December 27 assassination of leading opposition figure and former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto. In response to the IAEA directorgenerals comments, Pakistans foreign ministry stressed in its statement that ElBaradei has been briefed about the structure and control mechanisms put in place to ensure complete safety of our nuclear assets."
"Pakistan attaches great importance to IAEA and has extended cooperation and assistance to the Agency on many important issues. Our civilian nuclear program is under IAEa safeguards and we have always fully complied with IAE a obligations. After expressing condolences and outrage over events in Pakistan, presidential candidates turned their discussion toward whose foreign policy credentials were better. In a campaign that had been drifting toward economic issues, the turmoil in Pakistan could refocus voters on who is best qualified to deal with crises in other parts of the world."
"Sen. Hillary Clinton has spent a year calling herself the most experienced, most qualified candidate in the field. She stressed her ties with Bhutto and the tragedy of her death. This is one of the most important elections of our lifetime, the New York senator said. It certainly raises the stakes high for what we have to expect from our next president, she said."
"Sen. Barack Obamas camp insisted they welcome the renewed talks on foreign policy and called attention to Clintons yes vote on the Iraq war. The Clinton campaign said the suggestion that her vote caused unrest in Pakistan is baseless. This is a time to focus on the people of Pakistan and not politics, said Obama adviser David Axelrod. Watch how the assassination is resonating on the campaign trail here."
Obama: This is one of those situations where Washington is putting a spin on it. He in no way was suggesting Hillary Clinton was somehow directly to blame for this situation. The Illinois senator added that its important for us to not look at this in terms of shortterm political points scoring.
"Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani talked terrorism, connecting the attack in Pakistan to the September 11, 2001, attacks. McCain, who along with Giuliani scores best on national security, bluntly challenged Giulianis foreign policy experience."
"Bill Richardson said he would call on Pakistans President Pervez Musharraf to step down. Former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson said calling for Musharraf to resign wouldnt be a good idea. What is in U.S. interest is for there to be a stable, democratic Pakistan that is fighting terrorists."
"Former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards said he called Musharraf and urged him to continue this democratization process. Democratic hopeful Joe Biden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Bhuttos death was a genuine tragedy."
"Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee seemed to suggest Pakistan was currently under martial law. Huckabee's foreign policy credentials have been under a microscope since he admitted to journalists that he was unaware of a major report on Irans nuclear weapons program. Later Thursday, Huckabee told CNN that it was not that I was unaware it was suspended, two weeks ago, lifted. The point was, would it be reinstated, he said."
"All of the aspects of martial law have not been completely lifted even now. Theres still a heavy hand Musharraf has used. If voters see a highstakes drama in Pakistan, that could resonate at the polls. Most of the candidates said they didnt want to turn the assassination into a talking point."
Lebanese civil war was in full flood when I was 14. We ran from school screaming. One afternoon the shells began raining down on our neighborhood.
"After more than a decade of relative peace and reconstruction, the bombings and assassinations have returned to Beirut. Every time I hear of a new explosion, I think of a frightened child sitting in darkness. The memory of that terrifying afternoon receded until recently."
"In 1988, I watched the last throes of Lebanon's civil war firsthand. Now I watch from another continent, but I find those same emotions resurfacing. The conspiracies, the car bombs, the threatening rhetoric and political deadlock are eerily familiar."
"In 1988, the presidents term was coming to an end and the warring factions were unable to agree on a new candidate. Then, as now, a presidential election is the setting, and the struggle where religion and clan play the main roles."
Militias prevented parliament members from reaching the assembly building. Compromise was nowhere in sight. The West had abandoned Lebanon to the manipulation of its neighbors.
"In his last act as president, Amin Gemayel named fellow Christian and Army Chief Michel Aoun as prime minister. Muslims refused to serve in the Cabinet and the country ended up with two governments. Aoun famously declared I am prime minister and six ministers in one."
"Aoun turned on fellow Christians of the Lebanese Forces in the War of Elimination. When that failed, the Syrians drove Aoun to take refuge at the French Embassy. In August 1990, I came to CNN as a World Report panelist. I had seen people killed in front of me children orphaned in seconds."
"So when I was offered the opportunity to stay at CNN, I gratefully accepted the chance to escape the anarchy. But almost as I left, the civil war was being laid to rest. Peace came to Lebanon, but it would be five years before I returned. In 1995, I went back and was stunned."
"I kept looking around for checkpoints manned by militants. I couldnt believe that I could go anywhere without being harassed or kidnapped by one faction or another. No longer did identity  Christian, Muslim or Druze define where Lebanese could go."
"Downtown Beirut, once rocked by explosions and pitted with bullet holes, was rocking to Lebanese pop music. The dusty sandbags had given way to boutiques carrying the latest European fashions. Lovers had returned to Beiruts Corniche, overlooking the Mediterranean, for romantic strolls at sunset."
"On Valentines Day 2005, the Corniche was once again rocked by an explosion. Former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was killed. On the day of love, Lebanon was thrown back into its most hateful history."
"Suspicion fell on Damascus, which vehemently denied involvement. Even after it withdrew its troops, Syria still had allies in Lebanon. One was Hezbollah, accused of the suicide attacks that had killed scores of U.S. Marines in Beirut more than 20 years previously."
Another was Gen. Michel Aoun now back from exile. The spirit of the Cedar Revolution had evaporated. Antigovernment Hezbollah squatters had brought life there to a standstill.
"Lebanese political actors now find themselves reenacting scenes from the final act of the civil war 19 years ago. Once again, the term of the president is approaching its end there is no agreement on his successor. Suspicion and fear are the political currency of the day."
Seven Manchester United supporters taken to hospital after violence. Violence flared before the 11 Champions League draw against Roma. Five fans received stab wounds while two others needed treatment for being drunk. Man United supporters were segregated inside the Olympic Stadium for the Champions tie. The match ended in a 1-1 draw between Manchester United and Roma.
"Seven Manchester United supporters were taken to hospital after fighting broke out on the Pont Duca dAosta bridge. Five are receiving treatment for stab wounds while two others, one who was a 16-year-old boy, were understood to be drunk. None of the stab victims is understood to have serious injuries."
The situation in the stadium is now fine and everything is running smoothly. The embassy had warned travelling fans beforehand not to use the Pont Duca dAosta bridge because it was habitually used by Romas notorious Ultras. Roma coach Luciano Spalletti condemned the latest violence.
"The trouble marked the second consecutive game between Roma and Manchester United in the Italian capital. Eighteen United fans needed hospital treatment in April after clashes on the terraces in Rome and outside the ground. The British Embassy in Rome had warned supporters faced a real danger of attack by the Ultras. The 1,200 British supporters who made the journey were largely shepherded into the stadium two hours before kickoff."
"Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, of Nevada is being sought as a suspect in the videotaped rape of a 3yearold girl. Stiles former girlfriend told CNN she believes she put him in contact with the girl. Tina Allen said she is disgusted and mortified at her role in bringing them together."
De Meo addressed Stiles directly Turn yourself in to your local law enforcement agency. Stiles former girlfriend said she is stunned by the allegations. Watch Allen describe her first impression of Stiles.
"Allen said she and Stiles had been in an onagain, offagain relationship for 10 years. He said hed been in the Navy and, you know, I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be, Allen said."
"I regret every, every step I ever took I feel bad for the baby. Todd Allen, Tina Allens son, said he recognized his old apartment from scenes in the video. He said his mother and Stiles spent time together there."
He said he never witnessed Stiles physically assault anyone. Tina Allen said Stiles hit her once but she didnt file a police report. She said she blames herself.
Allen ended her relationship with Stiles a few months ago. She said she believes it will be difficult for police to find him.
"He will hide out in mountains if thats what it takes, she said. Allen said Stiles stopped by her house last week for a friendly visit before his name was linked to the videotape. She said his appearance had changed."
"Stiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, is a former animal trainer, authorities said. Darren Tuck, a Nevada resident who allegedly showed the tape to others before giving it to police, faces a possible sentence of 10 years to life for exhibiting pornography. Tucks attorney, Harry Kuehn, said last week on CNNs Nancy Grace that his client had been wracked by indecision as to what to do with the tape."
"American al Qaeda member Adam Yahiye Gadahn renounces his U.S. citizenship. Gadahn displays his passport to the camera, rips it in half and says, Dont get too excited  I dont need it to travel anyway. The 50minute tape titled An Invitation to Reflection and Repentance was released by As Sahab, al Qaedas video production wing. It was provided to CNN by www.LauraMansfield.com, a Web site that analyzes terrorism."
"The video refers to the Annapolis Conference, indicating it was produced after last November 27, when the conference was held. Gadahn speaks mostly in English, he references Bush  who is to travel this week to the Middle East only in Arabic. National Security Council Spokesman Gordon Johndroe said the U.S. president would not be deterred."
"President Bush will travel to the region to stand with the mainstream governments. The selfproclaimed American jihadist, also known as Azzam the American, is on the FBIs Most Wanted List. Gadahn was indicted in 2006 on charges of treason and offering material support for terrorism. He is the first American charged with treason since World War II."
Since October 2004 he has appeared in at least eight al Qaeda videos in which he speaks in English and praises the terrorist network. Theodore Sorensen helped write John F. Kennedys 1960 speech on Catholicism. He helped draft a speech addressing the separation between church and state.
"Sorensen: Did Kennedys 1960 speech win him the presidency? He obviously didnt lose it, nor did he free the country from the curse of antiCatholicism. The hate mail still poured into his office. The vicious picket signs were still seen out on the campaign trail, and, indeed, on Election Day."
More people voted against Kennedy because of his religion than any other reason. Watch Sorensen discuss why Kennedy gave his speech . Could President Kennedy have delivered the speech Romney gave on Thursday? Mr. Romneys position on many of the issues are very different than JFKs.
JFK believed that no one needed to worry about a Catholic bishop or a cardinal dictating to him as a president. Romney felt compelled for some reason to define his personal views of Jesus Christ. Romney emphasized the role of religion in public life more strongly than JFK did or would have.
"Kennedy said, as you noted, his personal views of religion were totally his business and not the business of the American people. Romney made the statement freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom. Do you think Kennedy would have agreed with that?"
"As an old speechwriter, I would congratulate Mr. Romney. I think he touched all the bases he wanted to touch. Why did Kennedy avoid discussing his religious views?"
"Sorensen: I dont think Mr. Romney should be denied the presidency because of his religion. Kennedy began the speech by saying his private religious beliefs  his relationship with God or Jesus Christ or anything else was not a matter of public discussion. He did not think the election should be based on  as he said, its not what kind of church I believe in."
"Just as I dont think Senator Barack Obama should be denied because of his race. Or that Mrs. Hillary Clintonshould be denied the presidency because of her gender. This country is in deep, serious trouble, and thoughtful citizens surely are going to make up their minds based on the major issues confronting the country."
"The Boeing 777 first entered service on June 7, 1995. The aircraft seats between 301 and 368 passengers in a threeclass configuration. Since its inaugural flight, Boeing has extended the 777 family to five commercial passenger models. On November 9 and 10, 2005, a Boeing 777200LR Worldliner set a new world record for distance traveled nonstop by a commercial jetliner."
"The 777200LR set a record distance of 21,601 km on a route traveling eastbound from Hong Kong to London Heathrow. The flight lasted 22 hours and 42 minutes. The achievements was recognized by the U.S. National Aeronautics Association and the Guinness Book of Records. The Federation eéronautique Internationale recognized the Boeing 777 in April 1997 for achieving a speed and distance record."
"Boeing prides itself on the 777s landing gear, which it claims is the largest ever incorporated into a commercial aircraft. Each main landing gear is fitted with six wheels, while the nose gear has two. Donors pledge 7.4 billion to help build a Palestinian state."
"Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad called the pledge of money a vote of confidence in the Palestinians. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the support of donors needed to be repaid in the coming months with steps to create a lasting settlement. The Paris conference focuses on shortterm priorities for the Palestinians, and French President Nicolas Sarkozy said those include providing immediate support for the Palestinian people. The International Monetary Fund said it would provide monitoring of the Palestinians promised reforms."
"French President Nicolas Sarkozy said France would donate 300 million, and the United States was expected to pledge more than 500 million. Central to the Palestinians request for aid is a threeyear reform plan that the Palestinians prepared for the conference. The plan, which covers 2008 to 2010, centers on economic development and government reform."
"The World Bank praised the plan, calling it a promising effort to link policymaking, planning and budgeting. But in a report released Monday, the World Bank pointed out the reforms would succeed in helping Palestinians only if they were accompanied by both donor aid and Israeli actions. Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni spoke of taking such actions."
"Sarkozy repeatedly told the conference he is a friend of Israel. He urged the Israeli government to withdraw troops from the West Bank. The World Banks report detailed the challenges facing attempts to revive the Palestinian economy, which has become almost totally dependent on foreign aid. Abbas earlier had requested 5.6 billion in aid over the next three years."
"The Palestinian Authority is the largest employer for its people, as privatesector jobs dry up. The World Bank said wages for public sector employees account for almost half of the governments expenditures. Almost all government funds in the past two years have been used to pay salaries and cover operating costs. Staffing also has gone up in the health and education sectors."
"Gaza has been subject to a wideranging crackdown since Hamas took power in June its borders are closed, fuel imports are restricted, and there are strict limits on all imported goods. The continued entry of humanitarian goods has mitigated the impact of the closures on Gazas population, but has not been sufficient to offset the collapse of the private sector there. Unemployment across the Palestinian territories stands at nearly 23 percent, the World Bank said, but in Gaza, 33 percent of the population is out of a job."
"Lantos represented his Northern California district for 14 terms. He died at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. Lantos life was defined by courage, optimism, and unwavering dedication to his principles and to his family, said his wife, Annette, his childhood sweetheart, in a statement the House of Representatives released."
Lantos was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in December. He was serving his 14th term in the House. Rice described Lantos as the embodiment of what it meant to have ones freedom denied and then to find it and to insist that Americans stand for spreading the benefits of freedom to others.
"Lantos is the only Holocaust survivor to have served in Congress. He announced last month that he would not seek a new term. ""I will never be able to express fully my profoundly felt gratitude to this great country,"" Lantos said in a statement at the time."
The Hungarianborn Lantos came to the United States in 1947 after surviving a forcedlabor camp in his Naziallied homeland. He escaped and was sheltered in a Budapest safe house set up by Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg. He arrived in the U.S. after being awarded an academic scholarship to study.
"Lantos was the latest of more than a dozen members to announce plans to leave the House. His San Franciscoarea district is solidly Democratic, and he won reelection with more than threequarters of the vote in 2006. He supported the 2002 congressional resolution that authorized President Bush to launch the invasion of Iraq but later became an outspoken critic of the conflict. All vehicles were banned from the largely Shiite city of Amara Wednesday after three car bombs ripped through a market district."
The blasts detonated in close succession in a commercial area in the central section of Amara. The city has been the scene of fighting between rival Shiite factions. Baghdad was also hit by violence on Wednesday. A car bomb there killed five Iraqi civilians and wounded 15 others.
"Maj. Gen. Abdul Karim Khalaf, head of the Interior Ministrys National Command Center, confirmed the casualty figures in the Amara bombing. He said the ministry fired the citys police chief in the aftermath of the attack."
"The first bomb, in a car parked in a commercial area, detonated about 930 a.m. As onlookers gathered, the second one exploded in a nearby garage. It was followed by a third bomb in the garage a few minutes after that."
"Prime Minister Nuri alMaliki denounced the attack. Most of the casualties were women and children, an Iraqi TV station reported. Maysan, which borders Iran, has been under Iraqi security control much of this year. It was not immediately known who was responsible for the blasts, but the violence is a reminder of the intense fighting between the Mehdi Army, Muqtada alSadr's militia and the Badr Brigade, an SICI militia."
"The two movements are bitter rivals and have been in the middle of local power struggles in Iraqs southern provinces. Britain, which has been in command of the south since the Iraqi war began, has been working to withdraw its troops from the region. Despite this latest violence, the region has always been more stable than Baghdad and other outlying regions."
"Kenya has enjoyed a reputation as one of East Africas most stable nations since achieving independence from the UK in 1963. A booming tourism industry, impressive economic growth and decades of peace have served to disguise widespread poverty, violent crime and corruption. Tribal bonds remain stronger than national identity in Kenya, with the countrys 36 million people claiming allegiance to around 40 different tribes."
"President Mwai Kibaki is a member of Kenyas largest Kikuyu tribe. He faces off against opposition leader Raila Odinga of the Luo tribe. The Kikuyus make up about 22 percent of the country's population. Jomo Kenyatta, president from 1964 until 1978, was a KikuyU. He was succeeded by Daniel Arap Moi of the Kalenjin tribe."
"The Luo make up around 13 percent of the population, mostly in the west of the country. But they also form a sizeable community in some of Nairobis most notorious slums, such as the vast Kibera shantytown. This weeks violence came as election officials declared victory for Kibaki with 51.3 percent to 48.7 percent for Odinga in the closest presidential vote in Kenyan electoral history."
"Kibakis first election success in 2002 was hailed at the time as a step forward for Kenyan democracy. However, his term has been dogged by allegations of corruption and graft. Irshad Manji is a controversial Muslim feminist and activist from Toronto, Canada. She is the author of the book, ""The Death of Benazir Bhuttos"""
"While far more liberal and democratic than Gen. Musharraf, Bhutto disappointed moderate, modern Pakistanis with her adherence to feudal politics. American feminists say they are aching over the loss of our dear, sweet, brave Benazir. But brave is not the word used by Pakistani women from whom Ive also heard."
"During Bhutto's time in office, Pakistan didnt defy the antifemale rape and adultery laws. Those notorious ordinances, known as Hudood, took their inspiration from tribal politics masquerading as Islam. Imagine the opportunity Bhuttos could have championed a purer faith by tackling corrupt cultural practices."
"In so doing, she might have created allies among conservatives, who can be persuaded that although Islam is Godgiven, culture is manmade. But not because of her. And that, say many progressive Pakistanis, amputates Bhuttos legacy."
"An exceptional leader can tap into it. There was a time when Pakistans democratic politicians stuck it to the feudal fanatics. Bhuttos father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was once heckled by a religious fundamentalist. His response captured the spirit of Muhammad Ali Jinnah."
"In 1947, Jinnah exuded high hopes for his people. You are free to go to your temples, he said. You may belong to any religion or caste or creed. That has nothing to do with the business of the state. You will find that in due course of time, Hindus will cease to be Hindus."
"Jinnah meant every word of his unconventional vision because he, himself, lived as a maverick. He adored his nonMuslim wife, and his sister often appeared with him on the campaign trail. Her visibility attested to Islams embrace of women as partners of men."
"The United States lapsed into divisiveness following the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. Many would argue that todays politics of polarization can be traced to the unresolved trauma of the KingKennedy murders. For Pakistan, its high time to transcend both trauma and tribalism."
"Saudi King Abdullah has pardoned a rape victim who had been sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in prison. The case cast light on the treatment of women under Saudi Arabias strict Islamic law. King Abdullah issued a royal pardon Monday, the same day that the Hajj, the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, begins in Saudi Arabia."
"The victims husband said he has not received an official letter regarding her pardon. He thanked King Abdullah for the pardon, saying This fatherly care and noble gesture will help in lifting the emotional and psychological stress and suffering that our family has been enduring. Saudi sources told CNN that the kings pardon was not related to the beginning of the Hajj nor the Eid alAdha festival that follows."
"Saudi court ruled the 19yearold had an illegitimate relationship with a man who was not her husband. The rape took place in Qatif in March 2006 when the woman was engaged to be married. The White House welcomed King Abdullahs decision, but stressed that this is obviously a matter for the Saudi Arabians and King Abdullah. The decision did not reflect any lack of confidence in the Saudi justice system."
"The case has drawn international attention, provoked outrage in the West. The woman was meeting with a man described as a former friend when they were abducted. Seven men, convicted of abducting the pair and raping her, were sentenced from two to nine years in prison. Abdul Rahman alLahim, the lawyer who represented the woman, faced a disciplinary hearing for insulting the Supreme Judicial Council. The hearing has been postponed."
"The womans husband has been outspoken in his support for his wife. He called a Lebanese TV show to defend her, when a former Saudi judge claimed on the program that she spoiled their marital bed. AlLahim has said he hopes the case changes the Saudi justice system."
"U.S. President George W. Bush said last week that King Abdullah knows our position loud and clear on the case. Under Saudi law, women are subject to numerous restrictions, including a strict dress code. Claims by Dianas former butler that he knew a mysterious secret about the late princess have been trashed by the coroner in her inquest."
"Paul Burrell was once described by the princess as her rock. On Monday he told the inquest the letter contained a secret, which he claimed he could not remember. Burrell said the letter was not there, but at his home in Florida. The coroner said the information was already in the public domain and some of it was even mentioned in one of Burrells own books."
Burrell handed the coroner a note that he said contained the supposed secret. The coroner revealed that what Burrell referred to was that Diana was planning to buy property to live in part of the time. The location may have been in the United States or South Africa. The questioning of the former butler is expected to continue Wednesday.
"Diana and Dodi Fayed died in a Paris tunnel in the early hours of August 31, 1997. They had driven away from the Ritz Hotel in a black Mercedes with paparazzi chasing behind. There has been speculation that the couple had planned a big announcement the night they died."
"Maggie Rae said the claims came at a meeting with her legal team at Kensington Palace in which the princess also made clear her belief that the succession of the English crown should skip a generation to her son, William. The mornings evidence also heard that Britains top police officer had advised the queen against allowing Diana to go on holiday with Mohamed al Fayed, the father of Dodi."
"Rae gave an insight into the princesss lifestyle, which she described as odd and lonely. It was during this holiday on the tycoons luxury yacht in the French resort of St. Tropez that she met Dodi Fayed. Diana defied the advice and went on the trip despite being told it was unwise."
"She said she did not believe Dianas claims of a conspiracy against her. She had heated her own food in the microwave, Rae told the court. I thought she lived in a very odd environment, she said."
"Paul Burrell, Princess Diana's former butler, gives evidence at inquest. Burrell was the first star witness of the London inquest, now in its fourth month. Diana once referred to Burrell as her ""rock,"" he tells inquest. Diana died in a Paris car crash on August 31, 1997, along with her boyfriend Dodi Fayed."
"Burrell, whom the late princess once called my rock, cast doubt on whether Diana was ready to marry Fayed. According to Burrell, the princess was still holding a candle for former boyfriend and heart surgeon Hasnat Khan. Burrell told the inquest that Diana asked him to listen in on a conversation in June 1997 with her mother, Frances Shand Kydd, who died in 2004."
"The inquest, which began in October and is expected to last another two or three months, aims to uncover the facts surrounding the deaths of the Princess and Dodi. Asked earlier in the day if he believed that Fayed was the one, Burrell said no, I did not have that impression. He also cast doubt on claims they were engaged or on the cusp of engagement."
"Dianas 18month relationship with Khan ended around the same time she started seeing Fayed in July 1997. Burrell said Diana had asked him at one point to investigate how a private wedding with Khan might take place, given that Khan is Muslim."
"Burrell said he suggested to the princess that she wear it on the fourth finger of her right hand, rather than the left. Burrell also indicated that the ring was not an engagement ring, as the Fayed family has maintained. Last month at the inquest Lady Annabel Goldsmith, a friend of Diana, said the princess had remarked that she needed another marriage like a rash on my face."
"Lawyers at the inquest asked Burrell whether he knew whether a special announcement had been planned for the Monday following the fatal car crash. There has been speculation the couple planned to announce special news, such as an engagement. But Burrell said he knew nothing of such a plan."
"Mohamed Al Fayed, father of Dodi and the owner of Harrods has long claimed that senior members of the royal family ordered the pair be murdered. He also claims that Diana was pregnant at the time of her death. But Burrell said that he knew Prince Philip very well and that he could not have been behind the deaths."
Some witnesses claimed that he wrote cruel and hurtful letters to Diana. But other correspondence shown to the jury appeared to be friendly and was affectionately signed. Prince Philip could sometimes come across as terse because he says what he thinks.
"Burrell worked for the British royals for 21 years and became close to Diana. He has written two books about his time with the princess. In his second book, Burrell told of a letter from Diana which indicated she feared for her life."
"The princess wrote that Prince Charles planned an accident in my car, brake failure and serious head injury. One of Dianas close friends, however, testified last month that she believed the letter could have been forged. Lucia Flecha de Lima said Burrell was capable of imitating the princesss handwriting."
"Burrell responded that Diana always referred to Charles that way, even after the divorce. The inquest has revealed that Diana was a prolific letterwriter who also received a lot of correspondence. Witnesses, including Burrell, recall that the princess kept the letters in her desk, with the more important ones stored in a special box."
"Queen Elizabeth told Burrell there are powers at work in this country about which we have no knowledge. That comment, which has been widely reported, was meant to warn him to be careful, Burrell said. At the same meeting Burrell also told the queen that he had taken some of Dianas belongings to keep safe."
President Bush chatted by phone with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Two senior Iraq national government figures met with the head of the countrys Kurdish region. Turkish warplanes pounded Kurdish separatist targets in northern Iraq on Saturday and Sunday as well as last week. Bush and Erdogan talked about the dangers of the Kurdish separatist rebels along the TurkishIraqi border.
National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said they discussed their common efforts to fight terrorism. The PKK has spent two decades fighting for autonomy for Kurds in southeastern Turkey. Some of its attacks have been launched from inside northern Iraq. The U.S. and European Union consider the group a terrorist organization.
"Iraqi President Jalal Talabani and Vice President Tariq alHashimi met with Kurdish Regional Government President Massoud Barzani. Iraqi Kurdish officials, while critical of the PKK, have denounced the Turkish bombing campaign. Last week, BarZani snubbed visiting U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in protest."
"Several people were either killed or wounded, Barzani said on Monday at a press conference with the others. They signed a memorandum of understanding to deepen relations further with their three parties Talabanis Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, Barzanis Kurdistan Democratic Party and alHashimis Iraqi Islamic Party. The three Iraqi officials also dealt with national unity."
Andy Roddick beats Kei Nishikori of Japan in straight sets in San Jose. American number one needed just 63 minutes to defeat the 18-year-old Japanese. Nishikoris won his first ATP title on Sunday and was on an eightmatch winning run. The American has won twice in the San Jose tournament in the last two years. Click here for more tennis news.
"Roddick barked at the young player as they exchanged shots at the net. Nishikori held his cool, did not respond, and just walked away. But when pressed he acknowledged that he did in fact understand what Roddick had shouted at him."
I told him to stick me with it the next time. I just let him know that he needs to finish it. I had no problem with it. But it was a monologue.
But as Nishikori served at 45 to stay in the tournament he made two crucial errors. He missed an easy slam shot that would have given him the advantage at deuce. Then saw his saw his volley go wide that gave Roddick the match.
"Second seed James Blake beats Jesse Levine 64 64 to reach quarterfinals. John Isner beats third seed Tommy Haas 46 76 63 to advance to the last eight. Isner will face Robby Ginepri in the quarterfinals in Delray Beach, Florida. The final was won by Kei Nishikori, who beat Blake in straight sets."
"Isner, the ATP Tours secondtallest player at sixfootnine, will next face Spains Guillermo GarciaLopez. Fifthseeded Mardy Fish also advanced, beating Germanys Denis Gremelmayr 67 63 63 to make the quarterfinals for the second week in a row. Taiwans Lu Yenhsun beat American lucky loser Wayne Odesnik 64 64."
"Lu will face fourthseeded Czech Radek Stepanek in the quarterfinals. Several Marines who were involved in the November 2004 offensive in Falluja, Iraq, are now the focus of an investigation into allegations that civilians were intentionally killed during the operation."
"No one has been charged in the probe, which is based on what one official told CNN were credible allegations. The allegations first surfaced on a Web site, defendourmarines.com. The Web posting includes an account from a Marine who alleges eight captured Iraqis were gunned down following a firefight."
"The weeklong antiinsurgent offensive in Falluja began on November 7, 2004. It sparked intense fighting involving airstrikes and housetohouse searches. There were reports of civilians being killed in the crossfire."
"One Marine will serve eight years in a plea deal. Another Marine withdrew his guilty plea, saying he acted under orders. Four officers are accused of failing to investigate and report the deaths properly. Haditha was a target of Marine operations to root out insurgents."
"At least 10 people have died and thousands have been left homeless in Ecuador. Authorities said the rains, which began a week ago, were the worst in a quarter century. Los Ríos north of Guayaquil was the hardest hit of nine provinces. More than 10,000 families have been affected."
"In Los Ríos province, five people died when an ambulance drove into a hole at the side of a street. A newborn boy, his parents, a doctor and a driver were killed. Streets also were flooded in the capital of Quito."
"Correa increased by 25 million the 10 million he already had allocated for the emergency efforts. He also directed another 88 million to municipalities. Once the crisis has eased, an emergency fund will give seed and fertilizer to help farmers whose fields were washed away."
"Italian tennis players Potito Starace and Daniele Bracciali have been banned by the ATP for betting on matches. Top Italian player Starace has been suspended for six weeks from January 1 and fined 30,000 20,890 euros for making five bets totalling around 90 euros two years ago. The world ranked 258, has been banned for three months and fined 20,000 13,930 euros."
"The Italian Tennis Federation FIT confirmed the news on its website, www.federtennis.it. They denounced the penalties as disproportionate, saying the players never bet on their own matches. The federation said the two were not aware of the ATPs betting regulations."
Starace and Bracciali said they were scapegoats for a larger matchfixing scandal. Alessio Di Mauro became the first player sanctioned under the ATPs new anticorruption rules when he received a ninemonth ban in November.
"An online betting company reported unusual betting patterns during a match between fourthranked Nikolay Davydenko of Russia and Martin Vassallo Arguello of Argentina. The company, Betfair, voided all bets and the ATP has been investigating."
"Trevor Rees, formerly known as Trevor ReesJones, was the frontseat passenger in the Mercedes that carried Diana, her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, and their driver, Henri Paul. He sustained serious injuries in the August 31, 1997 crash. Rees testified that he received anonymous phone calls and letters after the accident, threatening him to keep quiet."
"He said the caller told him to keep quiet, saying, We know who you are. Rees said he didnt take the calls or letters seriously. A lawyer also asked Rees about a supposed encounter with a woman in which he told her, If I remember, theyre going to kill me."
"Rees suffered major injuries to his lower jaw, the base of his brain, and his pulmonary system. He testified that he did not support the allegations by Dodi Fayeds father, Mohamed al Fayed, that British security services were behind the crash. He denied the security services paid him to change his story. At the time of the crash, Rees was working for al Fayeds security team and was assigned to guard Dodi Fayed."
He was also protecting the princess because she was Fayeds companion on the trip. He no longer works on al Fayeds security team. Rees has said what was once a good relationship with his former employer has broken down.
"In 2000, Rees published a book, The Bodyguards Story Diana, the Crash, and the Sole Survivor. He said al Fayed tried unsuccessfully to stop the books publication in England. Rees testified that he had two flashbacks in the months after the crash, but his psychiatrist told him they were false memories."
"In the first, Rees said, he recalled hearing the voice of a woman  apparently Diana calling out, Dodi from the back seat of the car. In the second flashback, he said he recalled seeing a paparazzi motorbike. Lawyer Ian Burnett then read from a letter written by Al Fayed to Lord Stevens."
"Rees testified that he was not lying about his memory loss. He said claims the couple visited a jewelers in Monte Carlo to buy an engagement ring were untrue. British authorities hold an inquest whenever someone dies in suspicious circumstances. A judge, who is also called a coroner, holds hearings to determine how the person died."
The inquest does not involve driver Henri Paul because his body remained in France. British authorities had to wait to begin the inquest until after French authorities concluded their investigation. The British police inquiry took almost three years and concluded in December 2006.
"Frederick Dominguez and his three children fashioned a Help sign out of twigs on a nearby unpaved road. The four sought shelter from the heavy snow in a culvert and removed their sodden socks in an effort to stay warm and dry. Frederick said that during the threeday ordeal, he and his children slept inside a log for warmth and ripped apart their shirts to wrap their wet, freezing feet."
"Christopher Dominguez and his three children were reported missing Monday night. The children's mother reported them missing, police say. Dominguz: ""You just go to survival mode. Every parent would do that. You would do anything, sacrifice yourself"""
Dominguez said he used branches and sticks to spell out the word Help near the culvert. He said his daughter was the first to hear a California Highway Patrol helicopter overhead. He ran though several feet of snow barefooted to wave it down. The three slept with their feet inside each others shirts to help stave off frostbite.
More than 80 searchers scoured the woods Wednesday until the four were found. Police vehicles equipped with snow chains rumbled up mountain roads to help conduct the search. Officer Steve Ward said he was piloting the helicopter out ahead of bad weather when he spotted Dominguez coming out of the culvert and waving.
"The family was found north of where ground crews were searching. The pilots could see the Help sign they had made with twigs on a nearby road. The family got lost Sunday searching for a tree, which they had chopped down but later abandoned. The little girl was in tears."
"He said they didnt have food, heavy coats or other provisions to help prepare for the cold nights. After the family failed to locate their vehicle, he said, snow and darkness began to fall."
"At that point, Lexi Dominguez said, I started freaking out. I just remember walking and walking and being like, were not going to make it, she said. And as they huddled for warmth, his sister sang songs to help pass the time until help arrived."
"I feel good, just happy to be home, said Joshua Dominguez. All four appeared to be in good condition as they were brought by chopper to the command post. The two younger children had some frostbite on their toes and a touch of hypothermia."
"The search riveted those in Paradise and beyond. Mayor Alan White, whose son played soccer on the same team as Joshua last year, said he and many others have cut Christmas trees in the same place where the family vanished. When winter weather sours there, he said, people in the woods can get lost quickly."
"The inaccessible area is beyond the reach of cell phones, authorities have said. Paradise High principal Mike Lerch said students had volunteered to help in the search. Christopher Dominguez had graduated from the school a few months ago."
"No Country for Old Men wins best picture at the 80th Academy Awards. Four acting awards go to Europeans Marion Cotillard, Daniel DayLewis, Javier Bardem and Tilda Swinton. Coens also win best director and best adapted screenplay, and Bardem wins best supporting actor. No Country is about a man pursued by death and the law across the bleak moonscapes of West Texas."
"Producer Scott Rudin shared the best picture award with the brothers. The Coens, who have been known for their arch style and oddball humor in films such as Fargo, O Brother, Where Art Thou and The Big Lebowski, received some laughs for Ethan Coen's laconic acceptance speeches. Were very thankful to all of you out there for letting us continue to play in our corner of the sandbox, Joel Coen said in accepting the directing award."
"DayLewis was more effusive in his thanks after winning best actor for his performance as a misanthropic oilman in There Will Be Blood. Ive been thinking a lot about fathers and sons in the course of this, and Id like to accept this in the memory of my grandfather, Michael Balcon, my father, Cecil DayLewis, and my three fine boys, Gabriel, Ronan and Cashel."
"Bardem thanked his directors and reflected on his role as a creepy killer with a bad haircut. ""Thank you to the Coens for being crazy enough to think that I could do that,"" he said. It was his second career nomination."
"His other came for Before Night Falls 2000, in which he played Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas. French actress Cotillard won her first Academy Award for her portrayal of singer Edith Piaf in La Vie en Rose. Early handicappers had bet heavily on veteran Julie Christie, a previous Oscar winner."
Swinton has appeared in dozens of films in her native France. She may be most recognizable to American audiences for her performances in A Very Long Engagement 2004 and Big Fish 2003. Swinton nabbed the best supporting actress Oscar for her portrayal as lawyer Karen Crowder in the legal drama Michael Clayton.
"Swinton beat out Ruby Dee, who had been considered a sentimental favorite. She played Mama Lucas to Denzel Washingtons drug kingpin Frank Lucas in American Gangster. Swinton also beat Cate Blanchett as a mid60s take on Bob Dylan in Im Not There and Amy Ryan a difficult workingclass mother in Gone Baby Gone."
"The Academy Awards opened with host Jon Stewart joking about the recently ended writers strike. The strike forced a cutback in the Golden Globes and threatened the Oscars as well. Stewart commented on the bleakness of the best picture nominees. All I can say is, thank God for the comedy Junos teen pregnancy."
 Juno was the only best picture nominee to top 100 million at the box office. Star Ellen Page received plaudits for her performance as the title character. Screenwriter Diablo Cody is famously a former stripper  has become one of Hollywood's it scribes.
"Cody won best original screenplay. The first award of the evening, for costume design, went to Elizabeth The Golden Age. This is for the writers. I especially want to thank my fellow nominees because I worship you guys."
"The best animated feature went to Ratatouille, a computeranimated Pixar film directed and written by Oscar winner Brad Bird The Incredibles. The Counterfeiters from Austria took the best foreignlanguage film. The movie is based on a true story about a counterfeiter who, after being sent to a concentration camp, was employed by the Nazis."
"It beat out three songs from Enchanted, the Disney film about an animated princess come to life. No Country picked up four, The Bourne Ultimatum earned three one for its rapidfire editing. There Will Be Blood received two DayLewis acting award and Robert Elswits cinematography honor."
"An American Airlines passenger complaining that she was having trouble breathing died on a flight last week. MedAire, Inc. said its physicians last year advised 74 airlines on how to handle more than 17,000 inflight medical events. The death underscores the importance of taking precautions before flying, a travel health industry representative said Monday."
"Flight attendants with sick passengers call Good Samaritan Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona. Emergency room physicians and a service able to translate 140 languages are on call to answer questions. Very rarely does the call result in a diversion, a decision made not by the doctor but by the pilot who must consider a number of variables beyond the passengers health."
"On average, the company gets about 50 inflight calls from commercial airliners for an entire day. Airlines contracting with MedAire include Continental, Southwest and British Airways. The top categories of inflight illness are fainting, gastrointestinal problems, respiratory issues and heart problems. American has its own inhouse medical team."
"By law, U.S. commercial airlines must carry automatic external defibrillators, oxygen and medical kits. Some airlines choose to carry extra, nonmandated medications. If a passenger already has breathing problems, airplane travel will only worsen the condition."
"Though flight attendants are trained to handle onboard emergencies, they are not medically trained, she said. Hydration and moderation are key, and passengers should carry water and a snack. Altitude amplifies the buzz, Drake said."
"The FAA began demanding that airlines carry certain medications more than 30 years ago. A fresh cast can also prove dangerous. The risk is reduced with older casts, which have typically already expanded to accommodate any swelling, the FAA says. The FAA says the list was tiny."
"During the 1990s, overseas airlines began carrying more sophisticated equipment, and pressure increased for U.S. airlines to follow. Congress held hearings and then required airlines carry more robust kits and defibrillators by 2004. American Airlines was among the first to do so, said Dr. David McKenas, who served for 10 years as the airlines corporate medical director until 2002."
"American Airlines buys its kits from Banyan International Corp., which describes itself as the nations leading provider of emergency medical kits. Each of the ninepound, 250 kits includes aspirin, alcohol swabs, nitroglycerine tablets, antihistamines, IV tubing, a stethoscope, a bloodpressure gauge, a bronchodilator, syringes, gloves, saline solution."
"It could be used if there is a medical emergency on board, but thats not its purpose, he said. More oxygen is stored in the cockpit for the pilots. There is no central repository where these things can be archived and then retrieved."
"FAA spokeswoman: Once someone leaves the aviation system, there is no way for us to track the outcome. President Bush signs a sweeping energy bill that he says will help the country become stronger, cleaner and more secure."
The bill  raises automotive fuel economy standards for the first time in more than three decades. It also boosts federal support for alternative fuel research and energy conservation efforts. A Republican filibuster in the Senate removed provisions that Bush objected to. The current fueleconomy standards of 27.5 miles per gallon for passenger cars and 22.2 for light trucks were established in 1975.
"The new bill sets a single average standard for manufacturers. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, DNevada, said Tuesdays bill was a great, wonderful first step for an energy revolution. House opponents such as Rep. Joe Barton, RTexas, complained that the bill will undo many of the efforts made to foster increased production of fossil fuels in an energy bill passed in 2005."
"Barton calls the legislation a noenergy bill and a recipe for recession. He argues its mandated conservation measures would raise prices for fuel, homes and appliances. President Bush stresses the role of faithbased groups in the fight against AIDS. He calls the struggle one of conscience and morals on the eve of World AIDS Day."
"More than 33 million people worldwide have HIV  the virus that can lead to AIDS, according to the United Nations. Bush was speaking at Calvary United Methodist Church in Maryland after meeting with representatives of religious and community groups. Faithbased groups like these are the foot soldiers in the armies of compassion, he said."
"Bush is asking Congress for an additional 15 billion to continue and expand the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. On Friday, he announced plans to visit subSaharan Africa early next year to see the program at work. More than 2 million people have died of AIDS this year including 330,000 children."
"The White House says the program has treated more than 1.3 million people with AIDS. Increased funding would boost that number to 2.5 million, it says. The program has been criticized for requiring that participating groups emphasize abstinence education."
"At the White House, about 40 people carried signs in support of more AIDS funding. Among others, the president met with Martha Chilufya, founder of the Mututa Memorial Center in Zambia. The center works with faithbased and other caregivers to serve more than 150 patients."
"Bush says the first lady will join him on his trip next year. A giant red ribbon is hung from the north portico of the White House to represent the continued battle against HIVAIDS. A 12yearold boy should get a say in whether he gets circumcised, the Oregon Supreme Court has ruled."
"M is the child at the center of a longrunning custody dispute between James and Lia Boldt, who divorced in 1999. Soon after, the father began studying Judaism and later converted. He also started teaching his son about the faith. By then, James had parental custody and told his exwife the boy would convert as well."
"Because the two sides disagreed, and were living in neighboring states, the conflict dissolved into ongoing personal and constitutional dispute. James Boldt said that as a Jew and the primary caregiver, he has a First Amendment right to practice his faith as he sees fit for his child. Lia Boldt countered her son does not want to go through with the circumcision."
"So rather than offer a definitive ruling, the justices order both sides to go to the actual source of the conflict. Forcing M at age 12 to undergo circumcision against his will could seriously affect the relationship between M and his father, they say. There was no initial reaction to the decision from the parents or their attorneys. The case is James Boldt v. Lia Boldt S054714.  A man who rescued a coworker from the jaws of a crocodile also accidentally shot him."
"Two men were collecting crocodile eggs by a river bank in Australias Northern Territory. A crocodile grabbed Jason Grant by the lower right arm. The second man, Zac Fitzgerald, shot the crocodile, causing it to let go of Grants arm. A second shot that Fitzgerald fired struck Grant in the upper right arm, police said."
"Two men are workers at a crocodile farm in Darwin, the capital city of the Northern Territory. They were collecting the eggs legally, police said. Four U.S. soldiers  three of them elite Army Rangers arrested and charged with planning to rob drug traffickers."
"Rangers Carlos Lopez, 30, and David Ray White, 28, appeared in federal court Friday. Theyre charged with conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine and with carrying firearms in connection with that conspiracy. Another Ranger, Randy Spivey, 32, is scheduled to appear in court Monday."
"Lopez, White and Champagne were arrested Thursday at a storage facility in Sandy Springs, Georgia, a suburb just north of Atlanta. Spivey was apprehended at Camp Frank D. Merrill, an Army Ranger training center in Dahlonega, Georgia. ATF agents had set up a sting operation at the facility, which is about 60 miles from Atlanta. The men were trained to defend the people and principles of this country, not to use their skills to steal cocaine from drug dealers at gunpoint."
"Lopez, White and Champagne were to commit the robbery while Spivey covered for them back at the camp. All four were to get a cut of the spoils of the robbery, the affidavit from ATF Agent Brett Turner says. The investigation began in November, when the ATF became aware that some soldiers were interested in robbing drug dealers of their cocaine."
"A subsequent search found that Lopez, White and Champagne were carrying semiautomatic pistols and an AR15 assault rifle. Agents also found a ski mask, binoculars and a Taser among the items the men brought with them. The Army Rangers are an elite light infantry fighting force capable of deploying anywhere in the world within 18 hours."
"Armenian President Robert Kocharian declared a state of emergency Saturday night after a day of clashes between police and protesters. Protesters claim last months presidential election was rigged. State of emergency will hopefully bring some order to the capital, Yerevan, says Salpi Ghazarian, assistant to the Armenian foreign minister."
"Clashes began when authorities used force to clear Freedom Square of thousands of demonstrators. Authorities moved in because they thought that there were arms there, and it turned out that they were right. The state of emergency could last until March 20, she said, but the government hopes that it will be lifted sooner."
"As of early Sunday morning, Freedom Square was empty, Ghazarian said. Protesters were demonstrating in a main square elsewhere in the city. After the president was forced to declare a state of emergency, things have quieted down, she said."
An Armenian woman interviewed by CNN said there was huge chaos when police moved in. She did not elaborate on the number of people injured or the extent of their injuries. Witnesses told CNN that Saturday mornings action by Armenian riot police was bloody.
"They just want their freedom. They just want to be heard. They are being beaten up, some people have horrible wounds. As night fell Saturday, the sounds of gunfire could be heard from the direction of the protesters."
"The man said his wife saw two demonstrators hit by a police car earlier in the day. The car initially did not stop, he said, but the protesters surrounded the car, dragged the officers out and burned the vehicle. The officers were able to escape, but he did not know the condition of the protesters who were struck."
"The opposition party immediately accused the government of vote fraud and demanded that the results be voided. Ghazarian said Sunday that the government had reached out to the opposition. ""We are hoping with the help of the international community, the opposition ... will come and enter a political dialogue,"" she said."
"The U.S. Embassy has warned the several hundred Americans living in Yerevan to stay at home. Opposition vowed to pursue its claims through legal means. Armenia, population 3 million, is a former Soviet republic east of Turkey, south of Georgia and north of Iran. Nearly 3 million gallons of sewage spilled into San Francisco Bay when a pump failed at a waste treatment facility."
"The 2.7 milliongallon spill occurred Thursday night. A pump failed at the South Marin Sanitation Districts waste treatment facility. The waste was released into Richardson Bay, an inlet of the large bay."
"Sewage and storm water was partially treated. An alarm that would have alerted workers at the facility to the spill also failed. The state notified local offices in the bay area within an hour of receiving the report, an official says. The accidental release occurred between 530 and 830 p.m. Thursday."
"The California Department of Fish and Game has had a boat and personnel on the water since early Friday. The agency has found no sign of sick or distressed wildlife resulting from the spill, a spokesman says. Marin County is just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco."
"Sixtytwo members of Gambino, Genovese and Bonanno families face 80 charges. Charges range from money laundering to illegal gambling and murder. The Gambino family profited from extortion within the New York construction industry and its labor unions, according to the charges. In 1992, John Jackie the Nose DAmico, shown in 1992, is one of 62 people indicted."
"Several companies allegedly paid a mob tax in return for protection and permission to operate. Four members of the Gambino family are charged with eight crimes involving murder. Other charges involve an alleged illegal gambling ring, said Richard Brown, Queens County district attorney. Nicholas Corozzo, reputed captain in the Gambinos, was involved in a sports gambling enterprise, Brown alleged."
"Those charges include the felony murder of Jose Delgado Rivera, who was shot and killed in an armored truck during a robbery in 1990. Key to the Gambino arrests Thursday was a member of the Attorney Generals Organized Crime Task Force who infiltrated the family, a spokesman for the attorney general said."
"Forty-five of those charged are already in custody. Arrests were made in New York City, Long Island, New York and New Jersey. In addition to the arrests in the New York area, police in Italy detained 77 people in connection with organized crime."
"Those arrests netted important members of a powerful clan in Sicily linked to Mafia boss Salvatore Lo Piccolo. Police say that in his attempt to rise to power, Le Piccolo tried to mend fences with New Yorkbased Mafia families. Those families included the Gambinos of New York and the Inzerillos of Italy."
"Investigators believe mob clans wanted to collaborate on illegal commercial ventures. Italian officials said the arrests were aimed at preventing these illegal activities. They warned that other Mafia clans in Sicily oppose the return of the Inzerillo family to the island, and therefore were concerned about a new Mafia war. The relationship between the American and the Italian Mafia is historic, based on long tradition."
"Saddam Hussein let the world think he had weapons of mass destruction to intimidate Iran and prevent the country from attacking Iraq. Hussein claimed he didnt anticipate that the United States would invade Iraq over WMD, agent George Piro said on 60 Minutes. For him, it was critical that he was seen as still the strong, defiant Saddam."
"He thought that faking having the weapons would prevent the Iranians from reinvading Iraq, said Piro. During the nearly seven months Piro talked to Hussein, the agent hinted to the Iraqi that he answered directly to President Bush. He told me he initially miscalculated... President Bushs intentions."
"Hussein asked his generals to hold off allied forces for two weeks, Piro said. At that point, it would go into what he called the secret war, the agent said. Piro: I'm not sure that the insurgency was indeed part of Husseins plan."
"Well, he would like to take credit for the insurgency, he said. Hussein had the ability to restart the weapons program and professed to wanting to do that. He wanted to pursue all of WMD... to reconstitute his entire WMD program."
He told me he changed... the way he traveled. He got rid of his normal vehicles. The twins get a checkup 22608  VIDEO Nancy Grace introduces on set 21408  The twins go out for a stroll 21108 The twins at 3 months 2408 The twins in January 12108  VIDEO First video of Nancy Graces twins.
" Hispanics are described as the largest minority group in the United States. Yet these descriptions belie the complexity of the 44 million people to whom they refer. Even the terms used to name them  Hispanics, HispanicAmericans, Latinos, LatinoAmericans, the Spanishsurnamed too tightly package the people categorized by those definitions, some observers say."
"Many of his films, such as Los Angeles Now and Brown is the New Green George Lopez and the American Dream, explore the experience and identity of Latinos in the United States. From a census standpoint, being of Hispanic or Latino origin means a person identifies himself in one of four listed categories. According to a Pew Hispanic CenterKaiser Family Foundation survey in 2002, that is how most Latinos choose to identify themselves."
"When asked which terms they would use first to describe themselves, 54 percent said they primarily identify themselves in terms of their or their parents country of origin. About one quarter choose Latino or Hispanic, and 21 percent chose American. The U.S. government came up with the term Hispanic in the 1970s to generally refer to people who could trace their origin to Spanishspeaking countries."
"The terms are often used interchangeably, which is a point of some contention in the wider community. But do the terms carry meaning among the people to whom they refer, or are they merely governmental designations? Thats the way you call our people, Susana Clar, 52, said of the terms."
"Manuel Baez, 49, is a native of the Dominican Republic who owns an insurance agency in Tampa, Florida. He never uses Hispanic to identify himself because I am mixed, Baez said. He continued, DominicanAmerican really represents who I am, instead of Dominican or Latino."
"Hispanic doesnt go with me because I dont believe that Spain was the best thing for Latin America. For me...there is no such thing as a Latino identity, said Suzanne Oboler, professor of Puerto Rican and Latino studies. Theres certainly a cultural understanding... And a political identity, she said."
"Carl J. Kravetz, a longtime veteran of Hispanic marketing, said similarities among the different subsets of Latinos do show a Latino identity. The Association of Hispanic Advertising Agencies embarked on a Latino cultural identity project last year to better understand a group of consumers they felt could not be adequately reached through the traditional Spanishlanguage market."
"There are definite cultural ties among Latinos, particularly between those born in the United States. Religion and spirituality have a strong influence on Latino life and perception of the world. Latinos tend to emphasize family individuality is not as important, and perceptions of time and space they have longer time horizons and have a relaxed sense of privacy, a group of advertising and media companies says. It is drawn along parallels in values and ways of thinking and regardless of country of origin, the group tends to cluster in a few areas."
"Chitel: Latinos should be reached with culturally nuanced media. Still, some chafe at the labels. ""Every time it comes up it just kind of annoys me and makes me mad,"" one woman says of her background. ""It creates very much an identity that is Latino,"" Chitel says."
The U.S. Navy has moved the guidedmissile destroyer USS Cole and other ships to the eastern Mediterranean Sea off Lebanon. Pentagon officials said Thursday that the move was in response to a threat from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.
"The deployment comes amid a political standoff over Lebanons presidency, but the Navy would not say whether the events are linked. The Cole was badly damaged by an al Qaeda bombing during a port call in Yemen in 2000, killing 17 sailors. Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the presence is important."
"The destroyer and two support ships are close to Lebanon but out of visual range of the coast. Another six vessels, led by the amphibious assault ship USS Nassau, are near Italy. Mullen would not say whether the deployment has anything to do with the upcoming Lebanese parliamentary vote."
"The U.S. is concerned about the situation in Lebanon, a Bush administration official says. Lebanon has been without a president since November. The country's proWestern majority in parliament and the proSyrian opposition have battled for power over the last three years. The ships should be there a while, the official adds."
Lebanon has been wracked by a sometimesviolent power struggle since the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. disagreements over how to share power in a future Cabinet have kept the issue from coming up for a vote. Parliament speaker Nabih Berris office announced Tuesday that the next planned session has been pushed back to March 11.
"Sen. Hillary Clinton claimed victory in Texas, Ohio and Rhode Island. Texas and Ohio were considered mustwins for her campaign. Sen. Barack Obama had won 12 straight contests since Super Tuesday on February 5."
"Texas also held Democratic caucuses Tuesday, but it was too close to declare a winner. For everyone who works hard and never gives up  this one is for you, Clinton said before supporters in Columbus. As Ohio goes, so goes the nation, she said."
"Obama congratulated Clinton on her victories but downplayed his losses. McCain won primaries in Texas, Ohio, Vermont and Rhode Island. Obama: We have nearly the same delegate lead as we had this morning, and we are on our way to winning this nomination."
"I am very, very grateful and pleased to note that tonight, my friends, we have won enough delegates, McCain told supporters Tuesday night. Mike Huckabee dropped out of the Republican race after the results came in. Its now important that we turn our attention not to what could have been or what we wanted to have been, but now what must be, Huckabee told a crowd in Dallas."
"McCain is slated to go to the White House on Wednesday to receive the endorsement of President Bush. McCain overwhelmingly won moderates and conservatives in Ohio, but he lost the evangelical vote to Huckabee. McCain said earlier Tuesday that he was confident he would emerge as the presumptive nominee by the end of the night."
Parts of Cuyahoga county open an extra hour. Clinton held a twotoone advantage over Obama with Hispanic voters. Obama had the overwhelming advantage with black voters in the states Democratic primary. See countybycounty results in Ohio.
"Eightythree percent of blacks voted for Obama, while 16 percent supported Clinton. 64 percent of Hispanics backed Clinton, while 32 percent went for Obama. Obama appealed most strongly to younger voters while older voters favored Clinton."
"Among voters aged 18 to 29, Obama led Clinton 6139 percent, and among voters 60 and older, Clinton led Obama 63 36 percent. The 193 delegates that Texas will send to the Democratic National Convention will be split between Obama and Clinton according to the results of both the primary and the caucuses."
"State party officials say the dual primarycaucus system promotes participation in the party. Both Clinton and Obama have encouraged supporters to do the Texas twostep and vote in both events. Neither candidate is close to the 2,025 needed to win the Democratic nomination."
"Former President Bill Clinton said in February that if his wife won Ohio and Texas, shed go on to win the nomination. The top three Democratic presidential candidates face off in a Monday night debate in South Carolina. The hearts and minds of AfricanAmerican voters on the line."
The debate comes five days before the Democratic primary in South Carolina. Hillary Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina share the stage. The debate was put together by CNN and the Congressional Black Caucus Institute.
"A CNNOpinion Research Corp. poll released Friday suggested that nearly 60 percent of black registered Democrats were backing Obama. Thats a major shift from October, when AfricanAmericans backed Clinton over Obama, 57 percent to 33 percent. Having a debate on Martin Luther King Jr. Day in South Carolina is very fitting, said David Bohrman, CNN senior vice president and Washington bureau chief."
"AfricanAmerican Democrats used to be reluctant to support Obama because they didnt think a black man could be elected. Now they believe, Bill Schneider, CNNs senior political analyst, said."
"Obamas lead over Clinton among black men is more than 50 points, and among black women, Obama has an 11point advantage. Entrance polls from Saturdays Nevada Democratic caucuses match what appears in the CNN poll. Eightythree percent of black voters questioned before they entered the caucuses said they were backing Obama, with 14 percent supporting Clinton. If elected, Clinton would become the countrys first woman to win the presidency."
"Both Democratic frontrunners were reaching out to AfricanAmerican voters Sunday. Obama, who often refers to King in his speeches, spoke at Atlanta, Georgias Ebenezer Baptist Church. Obama challenged the audience at the historic black church to take a look at a few lingering prejudices."
"The Atlanta JournalConstitution endorsed Barack Obama for president Sunday. The paper cited his appeal across many of the lines that have divided America. Hillary Clinton also visited a historic black church in New York on Sunday. She picked up the endorsement of its pastor, the Rev. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Clinton is running against Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal for the Democratic presidential nomination."
Butts: A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote to elect someone who has proven through time to me and to this community and this country that she has the experience to make things happen. Clinton: I have the highest regard and admiration for my friend and colleague Sen. Barack Obama.
"Edwards says he hopes what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Edwards would like to rebound in South Carolina, his native state. He won the primary there in 2004 when he was making his first bid for the White House. But he is running a distant third in most recent surveys in the state."
"On Sunday, Edwards sounded a cautious note, saying South Carolina was important but just one part of the long process. Also on Late Edition, the House majority whip, Rep. James Clyburn, DSouth Carolina, cited the timing of the debate to help put the spotlight on issues important to blacks. Clyburn is the highest ranking AfricanAmerican in Congress and was instrumental in having the debate held in South Carolina."
"Pervez Musharraf says Benazir Bhutto's assassination was her own fault. Bhut to was killed December 27 in Rawalpindi, south of the Pakistani capital Islamabad. She was standing in an armored moving car after rallying supporters for nowpostponed parliamentary elections. For standing up outside the car, I think it was she to blame alone  nobody else."
"Bhutto's head was above the roof and unprotected at the time of the attack. The cause of her death is not clear a bomber blew himself up near Bhuttos limousine. Musharraf, who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999, rejected criticism that his government did not do enough to provide security."
"He noted that she had already survived one assassination attempt and was given more security than any other person. Asked about the hunt for al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, Musharraf said, ""There is no proof whatsoever that hes here"""
"Pakistani ambassador to the U.S. Mahmud Ali Durrani told CNNs Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer that, If we knew where he was, we would have taken him out. Musharrafs comment about not specifically looking for Osama means that the Pakistani military is totally focused on destroying al Qaeda and the Taliban network and not just one person. About Bhuttos death, he noted only that the investigation is not completed and we should not jump to conclusions."
"I think hes a good man, the Arizonan told NBCs Meet the Press. But I think hes made mistakes, dont get me wrong. And weve got to move forward with these elections and have them free and fair."
"Hes a very smart man. Hed be one of the first to go. Theyve tried to kill him nine times, OK?"
"The Bush administration is considering expanding covert operations in the western part of Pakistan. The aim is to shore up support for Musharrafs government and to find bin Laden and his second in command, Ayman alZawahiri. Democratic presidential candidate Bill Richardson of New Mexico says it sounds like a strategy that makes sense. Richardson: We have got to take whatever action is needed."
"Detectives from Scotland Yard on Sunday once again examined the white Land Cruiser that Bhutto was riding in when she was assassinated. The detectives also watched videos of Bhuttos last moments three times, and looked at birds eye view photographs of Liaqat Bagh park taken from a building that overlooks the Rawalpindi public site. The team of five detectives arrived in Pakistan Friday after Musharraf agreed they should work alongside Pakistani agencies."
"Musharraf said he expected the Scotland Yard investigators to help solve all the confusion surrounding the case. Bhuttos husband, Asif Ali Zardari, wants a United Nations inquiry into his late wifes assassination. The Pakistan interior ministry say the former leader died when she hit her head on the lever of her cars sunroof."
"Riley Ann Sawyers was moved from Ohio to Texas by her mother. Prosecutors said they have not decided whether to seek the death penalty against the girls mother, Kimberly Dawn Trenor, and Trenors husband, Royce Clyde Zeigler II. Rileys body was found October 29 by a fisherman on an uninhabited island in the bay."
"Police sketches of the child were widely distributed, and police dubbed her Baby Grace. DNA testing confirmed the childs identity. Trenor, 19, and Zeigler, 24, were initially charged with injury to a child and tampering with evidence. But since the initial charges were filed last month the investigation has continued and police have gathered additional evidence."
The grand jury deliberated for only three minutes Wednesday before upgrading the charges. Trenor told police Riley had been beaten and thrown across a room and that her head was held under water before she died. She said the couple hid the girls body in a storage shed for one to two months before dumping it into the bay.
"A medical examiner said Rileys skull was fractured in three places that would have been fatal injuries. Trenor and the girl moved to Texas from Ohio in May to be with Zeigler. Sistrunk said the investigation is continuing, and a decision on whether to seek the death penalty will not be made until its conclusion."
"Abdul Rahman alLahem says the Justice Ministry has reinstated his license. AlLahem had previously told CNN that the judge revoked his license as punishment for speaking to the media about his clients case. His client, an engaged teenager, was raped by seven men who found her alone with a man unrelated to her."
"The seven rapists were sentenced to two to nine years in prison but she also was sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in prison. The womans sentence provoked outrage in the West and cast light on the treatment of women under Saudi Arabian law. Under Saudi law, women are subject to numerous restrictions, including a strict dress code, a prohibition against driving and a requirement that they get a mans permission to travel or have surgery."
The punishment of the lawyer or any lawyer does not come from a reaction it comes from a carefully examined procedure within a special council in the ministry. He said the council charged with deciding law license revocations had not issued any decisions in the case. CNN is taking an indepth look at contemporary Russia as part of the Eye on Russia series.
"Anna Glubokina, 27, jumped at the opportunity to send photos of her country. ""I think that Russia is like a mountain river fast, dangerous and beautiful,"" she said. Murray Gillis took this image of an ice sculpture during a trip to Gubkinsky, Russia."
"But I love Russia very much. I will never be bored here. I know that tourists like Russia, because of its astonishing churches and palaces. Many of those who sent us photos were originally from other countries."
"Arturo Fortun, originally from Bolivia, has lived in Russia for six years. He said he has very vivid memories of what it was like seeing the country on TV as a child. Fortun: I guess its sort of a defining element of who I am is growing up during the Reagan presidency and seeing the end of the Cold War on TV."
"Volker Kleensang, of Hamburg, Germany, frequently visits Kaliningrad, Russia. He said the Russian people will take time to become accustomed to democracy. Life is different there, but after a time, your impressions may change."
"Many people from Kaliningrad still use the old German name. Craig Dillon of Queenstown, New Zealand, visited the country after winning a contest through a New Zealand vodka company. He said he had a choice of taking an 8,000 prize or a trip to Moscow, and out of curiosity, he took the latter."
FBI and Department of Homeland Security issue a bulletin citing an alleged claim of responsibility by al Qaeda for former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhuttos assassination. An Italian news agency says al Qaeda No. 2 claims responsibility for the assassination. The only thing he noticed about edible items was that the water had a slightly different taste.
"Al Qaeda Afghanistan commander and spokesman Mustafa Abu AlYazid telephoned the agency to make the claim. According to AKI, al Qaeda No.2 Ayman alZawahiri began planning Bhuttos killing in October. Such a claim has not appeared on radical Islamist Web sites that regularly post such messages from al Qaeda."
"The claim was an unconfirmed open source claim of responsibility. The bulletin was sent out at about 6 p.m. to state and local law enforcement agencies. One Islamist Web site repeated the claim, but that Web site is not considered a reliable source for Islamist messages by experts in the field."
"We are not in a position to confirm who may be responsible, Feinstein said. DHS spokesman Russ Knocke said Bhuttos assassination had not prompted any adjustments to our security posture. Of course, we continue to closely monitor events as they unfold overseas, he said."
"Democratic senators will hold short pro forma sessions over the holiday break to prevent recess appointments. Nearly all the senators left the Capitol for the Christmas holiday last week. Democrats are keeping the Senate in session to block President Bush from making any recess appointments, a constitutional mechanism that allows the president to fill top government posts for up to one year without Senate confirmation."
"Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, DNevada, announced December 19 that he would keep the Senate open with a series of pro forma sessions through midJanuary. Talks had just broken down with the White House on a deal that would have allowed the president to make dozens of appointments if he agreed not to appoint one controversial official."
"Webb also did the duty Friday, but he wont be the only senator tasked with presiding over the shortened sessions. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, Jack Reed of Rhode Island, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Ben Cardin of Maryland and Chuck Schumer of New York will share the duty."
"Bush: Growth package must be big enough to make a difference in an economy as large and dynamic as ours. It should equal about 1 percent of the nations gross domestic product, or roughly 140 billion, he added. Bush: It will help keep economic sectors that are going through adjustments, such as the housing market, from adversely affecting other parts of our economy."
"Bush said the economy will continue to grow but at a slower rate. The president offered no specific details of the proposed package, but he did insist that it include tax incentives for business, including small businesses. Bush also said the economic package must include rapid income tax relief for consumers to lift our economy at a time when people otherwise might spend less."
"We want to include people who pay taxes, not necessarily income taxes  a lot of lower income people pay payroll taxes, said one aide. Sen. Charles Schumer, DNew York, said he was disappointed that Bush did not include stimulusspending measures aimed at helping the disadvantaged such as extending unemployment benefits."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, DCalifornia, expressed agreement with Bush on the need to provide assistance immediately. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, DNevada, said, I also agree that our focus must be on finding temporary measures that will do the job effectively. Sen. Edward Kennedy, DMassachusetts, agreed that we must act swiftly to boost the economy. Bushs remarks came a day after talks on the subject with Democratic and Republican lawmakers."
"Existing income tax cuts due to expire in 2010. Bush calls on Congress to make them permanent. Unless Congress acts, the American people will face massive tax increases in less than three years. This tax increase would put jobs and economic growth at risk, Bush says."
The proposed stimulus package comes as a leading gauge of future economic activity was released Friday. The December report showed a decline for a third straight month for the U.S. leading index. The report cited housing permits for the largest negative contribution to the index.
Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers stressed the importance of whom any relief package would target. Summers: It needs to go to people who are going to spend it. Bernanke told the House Budget Committee on Thursday that he does not believe the economy will enter a recession. He said he expects growth to proceed at a slow pace this year and possibly into early 2009.
"He said Congress needs to take decisive action to boost the economy. But he said any package should be explicitly temporary to avoid running up the governments longterm debt. Bernanke stopped short of suggesting that the Bush tax cuts should be made permanent, telling lawmakers he supports the law of arithmetic."
"In 2001, Americans received checks from the government designed to stimulate the economy. Twenty to 40 percent of the checks were spent within days. Consumers saved onethird of the money, and twothirds went back into the economy within two quarters."
"Passenger ship Explorer reported problems near the South Shetland Islands, south of Argentina. The area is in a sector of Antarctica claimed by the United Kingdom. The ship sent out a distress call at around 10 p.m. local time on Wednesday."
"154 people are reported to be on board ship, which carries a Liberian flag. Passengers and crew have been evacuated onto lifeboats. Captain and first officer are said to have stayed on board the ship."
"The great majority of people, including all the passengers, have been safely taken off the Explorer and are now being recovered by the first of the vessels. The passengers and crew from the Explorer have not been in lifeboats very long, Dave JardineSmith, head of the Maritime and Coastguard Agencys MCA search and rescue team in England said."
"She hit something and is taking on a serious amount of water, that is all we know. The temperature in the area is said to be at around minus 5C, with a sea temperature of around minus 1C. It wouldnt take long for hypothermia to set in at that kind of temperature, forecasters said. The boat is owned by Gap Adventures, based in Toronto, Canada."
"Todd Barber was moved from horror to action after witnessing the rapid devastation of a Cayman Island coral reef. Barber gave up a sixfigure salary as a marketing consultant and dedicated his life to restoring the worlds ocean reef ecosystems. ""When that one little tiny reef was lost, that sparked something in me,"" says Barber."
"Coral reefs are home to 25 percent of all marine fish species. 500 million people rely on coral reefs for their food and livelihoods. According to the Nature Conservancy, 70 percent of the worlds coral reefs will be destroyed by the year 2050. If we lost one and it took that tens of thousands of years to get here, how fast is this happening?"
"What started as a basic idea to shape concrete around a beach ball led to three years of research, testing and prototyping with the help of friends and college professors. Our goal was to mimic nature, not dictate nature, says Barber."
"Reef Balls are circular structures with a hollow center that serve as a base habitat upon which a natural reef can grow. They are used to mimic and rehabilitate all forms of oceanic reefs, such as mangrove, oyster and coral reefs. They can also help control erosion and stabilize shorelines."
"Today, the nonprofit organization works with environmental agencies, universities, community groups and corporations. According to Barber, marine conservation isnt just about Reef Balls, but theyre one important tool. Its about saving natural reefs."
"Since its inception, the Reef Ball Foundation has placed Reef Balls in more than 59 countries. For me, personally, the satisfaction comes from diving on a Reef Ball and seeing that the environment has been rehabilitated."
Valerie Gooding is in the top five most powerful businesswomen in Europe. Under her leadership BUPA has grown to over 8 million customers in over 190 countries. She said it goes beyond family issues. Women sometimes dont put themselves forward for things.
"Women often lack confidence to go for the next job, the top job. Partly a lack of role models, partly it may be conditioning from a very early age about what the role of women is in society and the family, in work. But also I think there is still an unseen barrier for women, which is that, if you ask most business people, would they like to promote more women, they all say yes."
"But often they dont really automatically think of a woman first for a top job. And what advice would you give to women who want to try and make it to the top? Gooding Well, first of all, to learn as much as you can and to make sure youve got the right experience, the right qualifications, and to enjoy each job for its own interest and job satisfaction. But I think another piece of advice I would given to women is not to be afraid to put themselves forward and say what it is they want."
"Gooding says good leaders should be judged on their results. He says of a great leader, the people will say we did it ourselves. Gooding says women in general as managers are more inclusive than men. He also says women are more likely to have children."
"In fact, I sometimes find these gender differences, when sort of represented in the business environment, are actually just not very useful. Because I have seen women who are more autocratic and more leading from the front and more dictatorial, and Ive equally seen men who are very consultative. So, I dont just think it divides that way."
"A fire charred the top of two of three wings of the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino. No major injuries were reported, but visitors and employees were forced to evacuate. Gooding: ""I think its the thrill of the chase, basically. Its the constant challenge, theres always something new""""I think thats what keeps us all going,"" Gooding says."
"A bit over an hour after it began, the fire was fully contained. Firefighters would remain at the hotel until the fire is completely knocked out. It was mainly an exterior fire, although there might have been slight damage to some rooms."
"No one was trapped, and there were no reports of major injuries. The 32floor building was completely evacuated. Welders had been working on the roof."
The blaze was reported about 11 a.m. Black smoke and flames poured from the fire. Most of the damage was to the top floor of the building. Falling debris ignited parts of an exterior ledge four floors below.
"As you can see with it being outside, our firefighters actually had to hang out the windows to try and cut the fire off. We directed our fire streams at an angle so we could make contact with the fire."
"Earlier, the smoke was visible from more than a mile away, CNN producer Darian Billington says. Four U.S. Air Force HH60 Pave Hawk helicopters with rescue crews were put on standby at Nellis Air Force Base. The hotel has more than 3,000 rooms, including 211 penthouse suites, and conference rooms."
"The Monte Carlo, a subsidiary of MGM Mirage, has about 3,000 employees. The hotel was built in 1996 for 344 million. In 1980, a fire across the street at the MGM Grand Hotel, now Ballys, killed 84."
"Huckabee said crisis sparked by Bhuttos death should lead to a crackdown on illegal immigrants from Pakistan. Huckabee official told CNN that when he said that, Huckabee was trying to turn attention away from scrutiny of his foreign policy knowledge. Huckabees foreign policy credentials have been under a microscope since he admitted that he was unaware of an intelligence report that Iran had suspended its nuclear weapons program earlier this month. The former Arkansas governor is a Republican presidential candidate."
"The immigration issue is not so much about people coming to pick lettuce or make beds, its about people who could come with a shoulderfired missile and could do serious damage and harm to us. The Huckabee official said he told Huckabee that his reaction to the crisis in Pakistan will be the story for the next several days, and until he is briefed and up to speed on Pakistan, a good place for Huckabee to draw the line is on illegal immigration."
Huckabee said 660 Pakistanis entered the country illegally last year. The campaign official admitted that Huckabees tough immigration talk is also aimed at helping him win male GOP voters in Iowa  a bloc the official concedes the campaign has been losing ground with.
"The number of illegal immigrants from Pakistan deported or apprehended is not mentioned in the latest report from the Department of Homeland Security. In 2005, the nation did not make the list of the top 10 sources ofillegal immigrants. The Border Patrol told CNN on Friday that it apprehended only a handful of illegal immigrant from Pakistan in 2007."
"A Los Angeles TimesBloomberg poll conducted December 2023 and 26 has Huckabee leading former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney 36 percent to 28 percent among likely caucus goers. The previous year, Pakistan was the last country listed, but no specific numbers were given."
"Mitt Romney has gone on the attack against Huckabee, particularly focusing on his record on illegal immigration issues while he was Arkansas governor. Huckabees Friday comments on immigration came after he appeared to make another gaffe Thursday, when he seemed to suggest incorrectly that Pakistan was under martial law. While commenting on Bhuttos death during an Orlando, Florida, press conference, Huckabee told reporters that the United States first priority should be to find the responsible parties."
"Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf lifted the countrys state of martial law roughly two weeks ago. Huckabee: ""The point was, would it be reinstated? Would it be placed back in? All of the aspects of Martial law have not been completely lifted even now"""
"The slip ought to be really bad news for Huckabee, said the National Reviews Jim Geraghty. CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider said the debate over whether Huckabee has command of the nuances of the Pakistan crisis would have little impact on his support."
"Mike Huckabee is a populist. His comments on Pakistan reflect a populist understanding of the crisis, Schneider says. Sure, the political establishment is snickering, but I doubt that his misstatements bother his supporters much, he says."
"President Bush draws parallels between the cost of pulling out of Iraq and the tragedy of Vietnam. Three decades later, there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the Vietnam War and how we left, Bush says. The White House billed the speech, as it did next weeks address to the American Legion, as an effort to provide broader context for the debate over the Iraq progress report. Bush also sought to shore up the perception of his support for Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri alMaliki, after voicing some frustration with him on Tuesday."
"Prime Minister Malikis a good guy  good man with a difficult job and I support him, Bush said. Sen. Edward Kennedy, DMassachusetts, said Bush had drawn the wrong lesson from history. America lost the war in Vietnam because our troops were trapped in a distant country we did not understand."
"Sen. Joe Biden, Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, invoked his own Vietnam analogy in a statement released after the speech. Biden said Bush continues to cling to the premise that Iraqis will rally behind a strong central government, but he believes that will not happen. House Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio said more Democrats are bucking their party leaders in acknowledging progress in Iraq."
"Many rankandfile Democrats have seen this progress firsthand and are now acknowledging the successes of a strategy theyve repeatedly opposed. But Democratic leaders, deeply invested in losing the war, would rather move the goalposts and claim that a precipitous withdrawal is the right approach. Former presidential adviser David Gergen said Bush ran the risk of doing as much harm as good for his case."
"Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri alMaliki calls comments by U.S. senator irresponsible. Sen. Carl Levin said alMalikis government was too beholden to religious and sectarian leaders to reach a political settlement. Levin called on Iraqs parliament to turn the nonfunctioning government out of office when it returns in two weeks. Bush had expressed frustration with the pace of progress toward political reconciliation in Iraq, saying if the Iraqi government doesnt respond to the demands of the people, they will replace the government."
"In his speech, Bush said withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened todays terrorists by compromising U.S. credibility. He cited a quote from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden that the American people would rise against the Iraq war the same way they rose against the war in Vietnam. President Bush has frequently asked lawmakers  and theAmerican people to withhold judgment on his troop surge in Iraq until the report comes out in September."
"The White House is trying to reframe the debate over Iraq. A recent CNNOpinion Research Corporation poll found that almost twothirds of Americans now oppose the Iraq war. 72 percent say the Petraeus report will have no effect on their opinion. 53 percent said they do not trust Petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in Iraq, according to the poll."
Militarists of Japan and the Communists in Korea and Vietnam were driven by a merciless vision for the proper ordering of humanity. They killed Americans because we stood in the way of their attempt to force this ideology on others. Bush said history proved skeptics wrong about Japans ability to become a free society.
"In defiance of the critics, Japan... stands as one of the worlds great free societies. They prefer the darkness and calm of early morning when their targets are most vulnerable, still sleeping or under the influence. They make sure their prey  suspected killers and other violent fugitives know what theyre up against."
"The U.S. Marshals Service is the nations oldest law enforcement agency. It is best known for protecting federal judges, transporting federal prisoners and protecting witnesses. Less known is the cuttingedge work of the agencys six regional task forces in capturing suspects."
"In 2007, the investigators from the Southeast task force arrested more than 3,000 suspects. On any given day, Ergas and his force are tracking 10 to 15 suspected killers roaming the Southeast. Already this year, they have been involved in a number of highprofile searches Gary Michael Hilton, the suspect charged in the killing of Meredith Emerson who disappeared while hiking in northern Georgia a fugitive Marine."
"Most of the time theyre chasing suspects outside of the glare of the media spotlight. Charles Leon Parker has been on the run since the 1980s after being accused of molesting his stepdaughters. Our mandate is to track violent fugitives  murderers, armed robbers, rapists and fugitives of that caliber, says Keith Booker."
"The Marshals were brought in recently, Booker says, after Parker allegedly called one of his victims and said, I wanted you to know I saw you and your daughter, and she sure is beautiful. ODonnell says it takes highly trained, high energy, really special people to do such work day in and day out, especially when theyre up against some of the most dangerous individuals in the country. Its not an exaggeration to say theyre the front of the front line."
"In one demonstration, Ergas steps into the simulator and responds to reports of shots fired at a workplace. A woman rushes to a victim on the ground, as Ergas barks out commands. Moments later, a man rounds the corner."
"The suspect hits the ground. A split second later, another gunman emerges, and Ergas blasts him too. Think of it as Wii on steroids."
"There are 50 different scenarios the simulator can create, with a technician able to change each scenario. A trainee can use a shotgun, rifle, Glock 22 or Glock 23. The guns shoot a laser and each shot is traced."
"Each shot is analyzed, because in the real world a law enforcement officer is held accountable for every bullet that comes out of his or her gun. No one wants to shoot anyone, Ergas says. Even officers that may not have pulled the trigger will be affected by shooting and killing someone."
"This is a model, he says. We overwhelm them with surprising speed and force. Thats what keeps us safe, and thats what keeps them safe."

"A Hanoi court convicted Nguyen Thi Thanh, 41, for violating regulations protecting rare wild animals. She was arrested last September after police raided a house that she rented in the capital city. Officers found Thanh and three accomplices cooking tiger carcasses. The three men received suspended sentences, ranging from 24 to 30 months."
"Tigers are universally threatened, with only about 100 still living in Vietnam. The southeast Asian country has banned trafficking in endangered animal parts. Such medicine men think tiger bones and other parts can cure arthritis and other joint ailments. Last year, the Vietnamese government unearthed 38 cases of illegal trafficking."
"Heath Ledger was found dead in a New York apartment Tuesday, January 22. CNN.com readers describe meeting Ledger in person, and call him humble and kind. Famous for his roles in the films, The Patriot and Lords of Dogtown, he was widely acclaimed for his portrayal of the homosexual cowboy Ennis del Mar in 2005s Brokeback Mountain."
Donal Logue met Heath eight years ago while working on The Patriot. He became a star while we were sequestered away in a small town in South Carolina. He surrounded himself with his friends from Australia and never forgot any of us he ever worked with.
"I last saw him in Australia when he called my name on a Melbourne street and introduced me to Michelle, his then pregnant girlfriend. Heath must have been in a place of great pain and sadness to be split from his wife and child. He was sensitive and unfairly victimized in his native country by the unfortunate Australian custom called the tall poppy syndrome."
"He was a sweet person, and less importantly, an unbelievably talented actor. Maybe the best of his generation. Dan Bova of Larchmont, New York once got a flat tire. He helped jack up my car and change the tire."
"R. of Perth, Western Australia grew up with Heath around the speedway racing circuit. I remember the night he was a little boy and his Dad was racing speed cars at Claremont Speedway. His dad was coming 3rd then in the final corner, the two lead cars spun out and Heaths dad Kim took the lead and won the State Title race."
"He was about as happy as a little boy could be watching his dad become a champion. Later Heath would pit crew for Graham Jones, and I crewed for my dad and brother. Heath and I were both the youngest on our crews so that meant our job was to take the fiberglass bonnets over to the hoses and wash the mud off after each race."
"I was staring at him working up the nerve to ask for an autograph. He saw me, started laughing and walked towards me. He said I was white as an egg and asked if he could do anything."
"Dena Michnowich of Glen Cove, New York was walking in the lower east side of Manhattan. She noticed a really cute man holding his little daughter on his shoulders."
"He told her that they had to make a right and asked her to point them in the right direction, which she did. I soon realized that it was Heath Ledger and I got really excited. He was so handsome I got the chills."
"I could also sense that he had a very sweet spirit. It was a very special moment for me. Im so sad to hear that he died. Leanne Scorzoni of Staten Island, New York."
"Michael Williams of Perth, Western Australia met Heath Ledger many years ago. He stopped to sign autographs while he waited knowing that to the people asking him he was somewhat of a hero. They were genuinely interested in their child, her development, and treating the rest of us including staff with respect."
"Tracy Kimball of Rock Hill, South Carolina met Heath Ledger in 1999 while he was filming The Patriot in South Carolina. I was a reporter for a daily newspaper there and he was at a press conference about the movie at Historic Brattonsville, a Revolutionaryera plantation. He was so very kind and was more than happy to sign my newspaper."
"The media was flocking around Mel Gibson, but seeing a new young and dashingly gorgeous guy standing off to himself, I approached him and asked for his autograph. He flashed that smile, grabbed my pen and used my back to sign the newspaper I was holding. We had a conversation, but I dont remember it because I was so enamored."
"His death really saddens me. He was such a talented actor and a new dad. Having a child the same age as his daughter, it makes me even sadder to think of her missing her father."
His portrayal of Ennis del Mar was lifechanging for many of my friends. He was a true gentleman and Im sure an amazing father. To make assumptions as to how or why he died is to bring more pain to an already devastated family.
"Adrian K. of Perth, Western Australia met Heath one night on the town in Perth. The onedegree of separation rule in Perth made him a friend of a friend. What struck me was his calm in the face of his monstrous burgeoning celebrity. With both of his feet planted firmly on the ground, he seemed"
"I was an extra in the movie Dark Knight, which filmed in Chicago this past summer. He was rather quiet most of the time between takes, but seemed to be a nice, likeable guy. It was great to watch him work, as he was very committed to his craft."
"His death is a great loss. I met Heath Ledger while working in Atlanta. He was silly, smiling all the time and we spoke about horses and riding lessons."
"He was down to earth and so very talkative. Just a normal guy, hanging out. His best movie was my favorite movie of 2005, Lords Of Dogtown."
"Heath played the somewhat obnoxious Skip Engblom, but thinking of all the other actors who could have taken the roll, I dont think anyone could have done it better. Even two of the original Zephyr shop boys themselves. Tony Alva  Stacy Peralta, said when Heath came in  did the voice he would use in the film, it was like hearing Skip from the past."
"There was definitely incoming small arms fire from insurgents in the September 16 incident in Baghdad, founder and CEO Erik Prince told CNNs Wolf Blitzer on Late Edition. There was no deliberate violence, committed by Blackwater employees, he added. Still, when asked whether it is possible someone with Blackwater screwed up in the incident, Prince replied, Certainly its possible."
"American officials are also coming up with ways to fill the security gap if Blackwater is forced to leave, AP reported. The Iraqi government accuses Blackwater guards of opening fire without provocation on civilians in a crowded area in Baghdad on September 16. Survivors told FBI investigators Blackwater Guards shot at civilians presenting no threat."
"First U.S. soldiers to arrive on the scene found no evidence contractors were fired upon, source says. But Prince says at least three armored vehicles were hit by small arms fire, incoming, and one of them damaged. The soldiers found evidence suggesting the guards fired on cars attempting to leave and found weapon casings matching only those used by the military and contractors."
"The traffic circle is very big, so those first soldiers on the scene would have needed almost a battalion to secure that entire area. So the jury is still out. Well see what the FBI report comes up with, but Im confident that the kind of people we have out there are proven military professionals, Prince said."
"A Philadelphia law firm has filed suit in federal court against Blackwater. The suit claims Blackwater created and fostered a culture of lawlessness amongst its employees. Prince called the lawsuit politically motivated for media attention, and rejected the depictions of his company. He said when the guys get it right 99 out of 100 times and dont have to use any force or any violence at all, I think they are doing very well, he said.  A mine exploded Monday on a road in southern Somalia, killing four."
"Victor Okumu, 51, a Kenyan doctor Damien Lehalle, 27, a French logistician and a Somali driver named Billan were the MSF workers who were killed. Another member of the team was slightly wounded, the group said in a posting on its Web site."
"Also killed was journalist Hassan Kafi Hared, 36. The remotecontrolled mine erupted as he was walking to a news conference. He was working for the governmentrun Somali National News Agency and a Somali Web site called gedonet.com. He is survived by a wife and three children."
"Hared is the second journalist to be killed this year, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. The first, 38yearold Norwegian reporter Carsten Thomassen, died Jan. 15 in a suicide bomb attack in Kabul. The medical humanitarian organization said it was evacuating remaining international members of it staff from Kismayu."
"U.N. drug control agency warns celebrities are glamorizing drug use. Treating stars leniently undermines faith in the criminal justice system, report says. Report: Celebrities get more lenient responses by the judiciary and law enforcement. Kate Moss faced allegations of cocaine use in 2005 but was never charged for over the claims. and that is regrettable, Professor Hamid Ghodse told the UKs Press Association."
"Last month, acclaimed singer Amy Winehouse was questioned by police after a video emerged which appeared to show her smoking crack. Last fall she was arrested and fined in Norway for possessing marijuana. Watch Ghodse explain how celebrity offenders are being given an easy ride."
"The hearing was postponed indefinitely, PA said. Supermodel Kate Moss also faced cocainesnorting allegations in 2005. The Crown Prosecution Service later said she would not be charged over the claims."
"Singer Pete Doherty, the former boyfriend of Moss, also has had a wellpublicized drug abuse problem. Earlier this month he was named by music magazine NME as its Hero of the Year. Paul McCartney and his late wife Linda were open about their marijuana habit."
"Tim Masters spent nine years in prison until new DNA evidence indicated someone else might have committed the crime. Court papers filed by District Attorney Larry Abrahamson cited newly discovered evidence. Report found that Britain, along with Spain and Italy, have some of the highest rates of cocaine abuse in the world."
"Timothy Masters was convicted of the 1999 murder of Peggy Hettrick. On Tuesday a judge threw out Masters 1999 murder conviction, and he was freed also in the interest of justice. Although the motion signals that Abrahamson is dropping the Masters case, he did not rule out future prosecution."
"Timothy Masters, 36, has been investigated for Hettricks murder since he was 15. Abrahamson said he has asked Colorado Attorney General John Suthers to appoint a special prosecutor to continue the investigation. The attorney general will announce his decision early next week."
"A jury convicted Masters 12 years after the discovery of Hettricks' body. He has insisted he had nothing to do with her death, and no physical evidence ties him directly to the crime. Masters defense team said he was framed, and that police and prosecutors sat on evidence that could have raised doubt about his guilt."
"The significance of Fridays motion to dismiss is largely procedural, but Abrahamson indicated earlier this week that it might be unnecessary to try Masters again. Abrahamson also has vowed to review all contested convictions in which advances in DNA testing may prove useful. Special prosecutor Don Quick filed a motion earlier this month citing four instances in which police and prosecutors should have handed over evidence to Masters original defense team. He said he wanted to examine the legal discovery process."
Police interview with a plastic surgeon who said it was improbable that a teen could have made the meticulous cuts necessary to remove Hettricks body parts. Police failed to divulge that a renowned FBI profiler warned police that Masters penchant for doodling gruesome horror scenes did not tie him to the crime. Investigations into how police and prosecutors handled the case continue.
" Spears, the star of Nickelodeons Zoey 101, told OK! Magazine that shes pregnant and that the father is her 18yearold boyfriend. Consensual sex between the two may well have been legal, depending on where and when it took place."
"Critics of the nations statutory rape laws say that laws that are ignored in some cases can be used to put other teens in prison. You have a disturbing disparity in how these laws are enforced, said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University. What this case should focus the nation on is having a more evenhanded approach to these cases."
"In Louisiana, where Spears lives, it is a misdemeanor for someone age 17 to 19 to have consensual sex with someone age 15 to 17 if the difference between their ages is more than two years. In California, where she sometimes tapes her television show, its a misdemeanor to have sex withSomeone younger than 18 if the offender is less than three years older."
"Turley said most states have similar laws but rely on prosecutors to be selective in enforcing them. The issue drew international attention when a Georgia teen was sentenced to 10 years in prison for having consensual oral sex with a 15yearold girl when he was 17. In 2005, Genarlow Wilson was tried for the rape of a 17 year old girl at a hotelroom party. While he was found not guilty of that charge, he was convicted of aggravated child molestation."
"Georgia law required a mandatory 10year sentence on the charge of aggravated child molestation. Wilson was released from prison in October after serving more than two years. The state Supreme Court ruled his sentence was grossly disproportionate to his crime. Under the revised Georgia law, the act now would be a misdemeanor."
"Spears, who turned 16 on April 4, says she is 12 weeks into her pregnancy. She plans to raise her child in Louisiana, so it can have a normal family life. Her attorney argued throughout his case that Wilson was imprisoned for an act that, while perhaps morally questionable, probably is going on among teens everywhere. He said statutory rape prosecutions of teens are more common in Southern states and small towns than they are elsewhere."
Police covered up the murder of a British teenage girl in Goa last month. Officers had initially said Scarlett Keeling had drowned on Anjuna beach. A second autopsy suggested she had been raped and murdered. A suspect in the case was arrested Sunday but Fiona MacKeown said she did not believe he was the man who killed her daughter.
"Goas Tourism Minister Francisco X. Pacheco says the police tried to cover up the murder. Indian media suggested the coverup was an attempt to protect Goas tourism industry. Police said they were investigating allegations of a coverup and the actions of junior officers. They should have arrested this man a long time ago and this issue would have got diluted, he said."
"Samson DSouza, 29, has been arrested in connection with Keelings murder. Police say they have sufficient evidence to show that he was involved in rape. Mother of victim says she believes police are trying to cover up the truth behind her daughters murder. She believes they have arrested him to make it look like they were making progress in the case. He is a local Anjuna boy who was a bartender at Lius, a beachfront bar."
"Scarlett and her family arrived in November for an extended vacation in Goa, known for its white sandy beaches and dance music scene. MacKeown said Scarlett was left in the care of a trusted male friend and his aunts. The mother said Monday she sent a letter to Goas chief minister asking for Indias Central Bureau of Investigation to look into the case."
"Goa is popular with Western tourists but several tourists have died from drug overdoses in recent years. Women have been attacked and sexually assaulted in Goa. A mine exploded Monday on a road in southern Somalia, killing four people. Ongoing violence in Somalia has devastated the capital Mogadishu."
"Victor Okumu, 51, a Kenyan doctor Damien Lehalle, 27, a French logistician and a Somali driver named Billan were the MSF workers who were killed. Another member of the team was slightly wounded, the group said in a posting on its Web site."
"The remotecontrolled mine erupted as he was walking to a news conference in northern Kismayu. He was working for the governmentrun Somali National News Agency and a Somali Web site called gedonet.com. He is survived by a wife and three children. This is a targeted attack and we declare that this brutal killing on the journalist and the aid workers is an attack on the society itself, said the National Union of Somali Journalists NUSOJ."
"The medical humanitarian organization says it is evacuating remaining international members of it staff from Kismayu. Hared is the second journalist to be killed this year, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. The first, 38-year-old Norwegian reporter Carsten Thomassen, died Jan. 15 in a suicide bomb attack in Kabul."
"The passengers were members of E Company, AntiTerrorism Battalion, 4th Marine Division. They were taking part in a training exercise at Fort Rucker, an Army post outside Ozark, Alabama. The unit is made up of reservists from Tallahassee, Florida, and Bessemer,Alabama."
"By midafternoon, 11 of the injured had been released to their unit from the hospital. Pictures of the wreck were provided to the news media by the military. Ozark is about 175 miles south of Birmingham. Despite the obvious claims of younger rivals Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, few can really argue with the 96 football journalists who voted Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite as the 2007 World Footballer"
Kaka won the Ballon dOr for his performance in the Champions League final. AC Milan defeated Liverpool 2-1 in Athens to win the trophy. The 25-year-old Brazilian was born into a middle class family in Brasilia. He moved to the San Siro from Sao Paulo for a fee of just 8.5 million in the summer of 2003. Click here for all the latest from the 2014 Ballon D'Or ceremony in Paris.
Kaka was signed by Sao Paulo when he was just eight years old. He made his first team debut as an 18-year-old. A year later he was on his way to Milan where he won the Scudetto and the European Super Cup. In 2002 he was named in Felipe Scolari's 23man squad for the World Cup finals. He played only 19 minutes of the tournament in a group match against Costa Rica.
"Kaka is a goalscoring midfielder for Milan and Brazil. Carlo Ancelotti plays Kaka behind a main target man in a 4411 system. With Andrea Pirlo and Gennaro Gattuso holding the central midfield area, Kaka has a license to roam in behind the lone striker. And Kaka does this with devastating effect, running at the opposition with pace and power."
Christina Laurean told authorities she was attending a Christmas party on the night her husband allegedly killed pregnant Marine Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach. Real Madrid have coveted Kaka for the last two years. expect the world transfer record to be smashed if Milan dont secure a place among Europes elite.
"Cesar Laurean is charged with firstdegree murder. He remains at large, and authorities say he may have fled to Mexico. Christina Laurean knew about the death one day before reporting it to authorities."
Maria Lauterbach was eight months pregnant when she was reported missing December 19. Authorities say she was killed four days earlier. A warrant allowed authorities to search Western Union records.
"Cesar Laurean, 21, is a naturalized U.S. citizen. The FBI says Laurean may have fled to his native country of Mexico. He mailed at least one letter from Houston, Texas, since his disappearance, CNN affiliate KPRC in Houston reports."
"The next day, Christina Laurean reported Lauterbachs death to the Onslow County Sheriffs Office. She turned over to deputies several notes from her husband that she said she found at their home. In the notes, Cesar Laurean said LautERbach committed suicide and he buried her."
Lauterbachs allegations involved two encounters  one on or about March 26 and one approximately two weeks later. Christina Laurean on January 11 told authorities her husband had denied the rape allegations. Dubois contends the facts show probable cause exists to show that Cesar Laurean committed murder.
Christina Laurean told police she was at a Christmas party for her husbands Marine unit during the late afternoon and evening of December 15. Lauterbachs charred remains and those believed to be of her unborn child were found in a fire pit in the Laureans backyard. Police have said blood spatters were found throughout the Laurean home on walls and ceilings.
"DNA testing is being conducted to see if Lauterbachs unborn baby was fathered by Cesar Laurean. The FBI is offering a 25,000 reward for information leading to Laureans arrest. Anyone in Mexico with information is asked to contact the legal attache at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City."
"A man who rented a room to Lauterbach, Sgt. Daniel Durham, told investigators he found a note from her December 14 saying she was tired of the Marine Corps life and was leaving. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama each accused the other of borrowing portions of their presidential campaign speeches Monday."
"The Clinton campaign accused Obama of borrowing from a close supporter, and the Illinois senator responded by saying his own words have been used by Clinton. Clinton followed up with a swipe of her own. If your whole candidacy is about words, then they should be your own words, Clinton said."
"Ive written two books, wrote most of my speeches. So I think putting aside the question... in terms of whether my words are my own, I think that would be carrying it too far, Obama said. Obama said he also used some of Devals words at a JeffersonJackson dinner in Wisconsin."
Obama campaign officials said Clinton had a pattern of borrowing from some of her rivals signature phrases. They circulated a YouTube video and list of these alleged instances to reporters. A central passage in a speech Obama gave Saturday aimed at convincing voters that his campaign is not just about lofty rhetoric is adapted from one that Patrick used in his 2006 campaign.
"The controversy is lost on the Massachusetts governor, who endorsed Obama. Obamas campaign had Patrick call the New York Times over the weekend and issue a statement. We often share ideas about politics, policy and language, Patrick said in the statement."
"The Obama campaign confirmed comments chief strategist David Axelrod made to the New York Times about the speeches. They often riff off one another, Axelrod told the Times about Obama and Patrick. Watch a comparison of Obamas and Patricks speeches ."
"Obama has been arguing that words matter. Saturday night at a gala for the Wisconsin Democratic Party, Obama said to frequent applause, Dont tell me words dont matter!I have a dream. Just words.We have nothing to fear but fear itself."
"In 2006, Patrick, fending off attacks from his rival Kerry Healey, told a crowd, Her dismissive point, and I hear it a lot from her staff, is all I have to offer is words. Clinton has argued that while Obama provides rousing speeches, she has a stronger grasp of the issues and the knowledge of how to use the presidency to start making changes. Speaking last week at a General Motors plant in Ohio, she said, Theres a big difference between us  speeches versus solutions, talk versus action."
"Whoever killed six people in a Memphis, Tennessee, home may still be on the loose, police say. ""Some people may think words are change. But you and I know better,"" Obama says."
"Two men, two women and two boys were found dead in a home in a north Memphis neighborhood. Three other children who were wounded in the home were taken to a hospital. Police did not release the names of the victims."
"Detectives are trying to determine the day of the killings, which could have occurred as early as Saturday. There was no sign of forced entry into the home, and evidence at the scene indicated that the killer or killers left the house."
"The four dead adults were shot and the two dead children were stabbed, sources say. The wounded children are a 7yearold boy, a 10monthold girl and a 4yearold whose gender wasnt immediately known."
"At least one of the wounded children also was stabbed, police say. A neighbor says he heard gunshots coming from the house Saturday night. Two of the children are in very critical condition and one is in serious condition, a newspaper reports. They were treated for gunshot wounds, a hospital spokeswoman says."
I did not call the police because you always hear shooting in this neighborhood. Now I wish I would have called. He said he did not see any movement at the home the next day.
"Bolden said a family that included a man, a woman and five or six children moved into the home about five months ago. A prayer service was held for the victims Tuesday morning at the familys nearby church, said Keith Norman, senior pastor at First Baptist Church."
"Another prayer service was scheduled for 6 p.m., he said. Police do not know what was behind the violence, the Commercial Appeal newspaper reports. ""We just dont know the motive or cause of death, but we do have four adults and two children dead,"" a police lieutenant says."
"Rob Robinson told the Commercial Appeal that he was the landlord for the brick, singlefamily house that rented for 550 per month. They were very nice, very polite to me, Robinson said of the residents. They paid their rent and even helped with repairs and stuff."
"Neighbor Leo Baker said he has lived nearby for 10 years but did not know the residents of the home. Ive been on a scene where there were one or two or three victims, but I dont remember anything this large, Guin said."
"Police have more than one confession in the case. Suspects identified as Venjah K. Hunte, 20 Eric Rivera Jr., 17 Jason Scott Mitchell, 17 and Charles Kendrick Lee Wardlow, 18. In 2000, police said firefighter Frederick Williams confessed to a shooting in Memphis in which four people were killed his wife, a sheriffs deputy and two fellow firefighters. The shooting appeared to be the citys deadliest mass killing since 1973, when 28yearold David Sanders randomly shot and killed five people."
"Taylor, 24, died Tuesday, a day after he was shot during an apparent burglary at his Miami home. The police investigation revealed the suspects thought the house was empty, Parker said."
"The men knew Taylor lived at the house, Parker said. At 145 a.m. Monday, Taylors girlfriend, Jackie Garcia, called 911 and said someone had been shot. Authorities have said she told police she was hiding under the bedding during the attack."
"Police say Garcia and Taylor were awakened by noise in the living room. Garcia tried to call 911 but was unable to, and used her cell phone instead. There was no evidence the line had been cut, MiamiDade police said. A breakin was also reported eight days earlier."
"Several drawers and a bedroom safe were searched during the breakin. Taylor spent four years with the Washington Redskins, but had been out with a sprained right knee. He did not play in Sundays game against Tampa Bay."
"Taylor was a firstround pick in the 2004 draft. Dubbing him the prototype NFL free safety, the Redskins credited Taylors teamleading tackling prowess for sending him to his first Pro Bowl after 2006. Taylor recorded 257 tackles 206 solo during his brief career, two sacks and seven interceptions."
"Mohammed Sultan Nafeeks teenage daughter moved to Saudi Arabia to work as a housemaid to support her family after they were displaced by the 2004 tsunami. Now she is on death row, and all he can do is pray."
"Rizana Nafeek was 17 when she started work in Saudi Arabia. She was convicted of killing a 4monthold baby boy in her care just two weeks into her job. Rights groups say the case underlines the vulnerability of many of the 1.5 million Sri Lankans who work abroad  nearly 400,000 of them in Saudi Saudi Arabia alone."
"Nafeek visited Saudi Arabia with Sri Lankas deputy foreign minister this month in a bid to secure clemency. Under Saudi law, a pardon is the gift of the family of the victim, and so far the parents of the dead child have refused to meet either the family or Sri Lankan officials. The cops told usGo and pray to Allah. If you can get the forgiveness of the parents, your daughter will be free."
"The Sri Lankan government is investigating the agency that sent Rizana to work abroad when she was technically still a child. The government remains hopeful she will be pardoned or exonerated. ""I am fairly confident,"" said Deputy Foreign Minister Hussein Bhaila."
Rights groups accuse the government of failing to protect its expatriate workers. They also decry Saudi Arabias legal system. His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa has been following this case very keenly.
"International law prohibits the death penalty for crimes committed before the age of 18. Sri Lanka reinstated its own death penalty in 2004 after the murder of a high court judge. There is no indication any of the dozens of convicted murderers, rapists and drug smugglers on death row in Sri Lanka will actually be executed, Human Rights Watch says."
"Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick is expected to plead guilty to federal conspiracy charges. The NFL has not yet decided what football sanctions, if any, it should impose on Vick. We asked CNN.com readers whether they thought Vick would  or should  play professional football again. Leah Perry, who sent this photo of son Bobby and dog Rosie, thinks Vick should not be allowed back on the field."
"Stephanie King of Arlington, Washington: Michael Vick is a disgrace. Stephanie King: Anyone thinking he should be let off easy for admitting his guilt is wrong. ""The only reason he did that was because he knew the evidence against him was so great,"" she says."
It wasnt until the eyewitness accounts were brought to light that he apologized. One cannot be sorry for torturing and killing animals. How can we allow someone like that to be a role model for children?
Vick should contribute at least 40 of his salary for what could have potentially been his maximum jail sentence to the Humane Society to help abused and abandoned animals. He should never be allowed to play in the NFL or earn a dime associated with the NFL. He is a talented individual and it would be a shame to waste that talent.
"He should be made to work so many hours per week, every week, at minimum wage at an Animal Shelter. Why not give him a chance to play again? Smoking pot is against the law, but hes been given a number of chances, and STILL isnt banned from the NFL!"
What he did was reprehensible. He is in a spotlight where he should be held at a higher standard for a role model. The charges against him are not football related in any way. The NFL needs to step up to the plate and be the man that Michael Vick is not.
"Allowing him in their league gives a signal that animal abuse is OK with them. Remember Jeffrey Dahmer started as an animal abuser! Want him as your role model or a spokesman? Kelly Koch of Holland, Michigan"
"Vick should be allowed to play after a suspension. Until I know the depth of the gambling angle its hard to be certain. Dog fighting is brutal but if its only dog fighting, he should get whatever the feds give him and be able to return to football once his debt is paid."
He wasnt the best QB to begin with. Anyone with such a blatant disregard for life  animal or human is not worthy of the position in life he was given. Playing in the NFL is not a right.
"Mr. Vick should be judged of his crime. Not by his fame, nor his race. He should be prosecuted as a person. This is how everyone should be treated in America."
"Everyone is equal regardless of popularity, fame, and race. This is not an issue to raise the race card. Even his socalled homies who were all black turned on him."
"Vick... committed a felony and now he has to pay for it. As for playing football... he should be banned from the league for at least 2 to 3 years. Leah Perry of Chelmsford, Massachusetts I dont think Vick should be allowed to play football, nor should he get off easy."
"I think Michael Vick will play football again, though at what level is anybodys guess. I do not think he should be banned for life. He may have gambled, but not on the game as Pete Rose did. A prison term and suspension would put him out of football for up to three years."
The NFL needs to ban him permanently. He shouldnt be able to use the obscene amount of money he makes to torture innocent animals. Kids looked up to him and how many of them will think that abuse is OK now?
"He should be working for the road department, picking up Road Kill off the streets. He was given the Golden key to a life of fame and riches and he blew it away. He needs to be banned from the NFL forever."
"These men are role models for the youth of this country. What kind of message would we be sending to them if we were to let him play in the NFL again? Not a good one, I can tell you that much. If Imus is going to return back to the air... then Vick should return to the field."
"You violate some people or beings you apologize, let the air clear and go on with business as usual! John Brandon of Old Hickory, Tennessee. To make a long story short  my family will never watch a game with Michael Vick in attendance. Richard Branson set up a magazine and then entered the record business."
"Billionaire Richard Branson hopes to take tourists into space in 2009. Branson: ""We wont create a business if somebody else is doing it really well"" ""The only time well create one is if its not being done well,"" he says."
"I love people, I love to learn. I never went to university so I see my life as one long university education I never had. Im very inquisitive, hence the fact weve gone to 350 different businesses."
"What do you look for in your key lieutenants? Branson Number one, the Virgin brand is absolutely paramount, they must do nothing to damage the reputation of the brand. And the second thing is to look after their team of people."
"At age 13 I was writing him letters on how he could organize the catering better and how the school could save money. And I managed to persuade him to give me a study to start my magazine. It was only when he actually finally came to me and said Look, youre either going to have to do your school work or your magazine, that I said Well, goodbye. Im off to do the magazine, but thanks very much."
"Without your persona do you think the Virgin brand could have ever become what it became? I think the particular Virgin brand perhaps needed me, in the past, to get out there and be adventurous, and therefore to give the brand an adventurous feeling take on the big guys. I think now if my balloon pops, or the space ship just continues to go into space, or whatever, I Think the brand is strong enough to withstand all that and itll continue to grow."
"From January 1 it will be illegal in France to smoke in cafes as well as clubs, casinos and hotels. In spite of the health dangers, about 13.5 million people smoke out of a population of 60 million. Around 26 percent of 15 year olds estimated to smoke, according to 2002 figures from the World Health Organization. In a country renowned for its fondness for romance, smoking has never quite shaken off its romantic associations with smoky Left Bank cafes."
"Smoking ban was first introduced in France in February this year to cover workplaces, schools, airports and hospitals. The new restrictions will only apply to the inside of premises, meaning smokers are still free to light up on the terraces. Authorities have agreed to an amnesty over the New Year holiday and will not fully enforce the new arrangements until Wednesday."
"France has lagged behind many of its European neighbors in bringing in legislation to curb smoking in public places. Ireland became the first European country to introduce a comprehensive smoking ban in 2004. Italy, Spain, Belgium and Britain have followed suit with similar bans. The toddler whose body washed ashore in Texas last month has been tentatively identified as a 2yearold girl."
"Investigators believe the child they dubbed Baby Grace is actually 2yearold Riley Ann Sawyers. DNA analysis is still in progress to confirm that identification. The childs mother, Kimberly Dawn Trenor, 19, and a man identified as Royce Clyde Zeigler II, 24, were arrested Saturday."
"The arrests follow searches conducted Saturday after a November 7 tip. The girls grandmother, Sheryl Sawyers, of Cleveland, Ohio, told CNN affiliate WKYC that Riley Ann has been missing since June. On October 29, a fisherman discovered the body in a blue Sterilite plastic container on an uninhabited island."
"Police dubbed the dead girl Baby Grace, and asked the public for help in identifying her. A medical examiner said the childs skull was fractured, and a forensic dentist estimated her age at 2 to 3 years. In composite sketches, the girl is wearing a pink skirt and matching top."
"She is very much a human being, Tutoilmondo said last month. We have adopted the name of Baby Grace because, there again, that is part of the emotional part of this case for us. Four suspects indicted on murder and burglary charges in the slaying of Washington Redskins star Sean Taylor begin their journey through the courts on Wednesday."
A grand jury identified Eric Rivera Jr. as the shooter in the death of NFL star Sean Taylor. Rivera has been indicted as an adult and Judge John Thornton found probable cause to support charges of first degree felony murder and burglary.
"Three other suspects  Venjah K. Hunte, 20, Jason Scott Mitchell, 19, and Charles Kendrick Lee Wardlow, 18. They wore thick green vests, which defense attorneys said were suicide safety smocks. They were ordered held without bail at the PreTrial Detention Center in Miami, Florida."
"Rivera was armed during the alleged burglary, and during the course of the commission of the offense... discharged a firearm. As a result of the discharge, death or great bodily harm was inflicted upon Sean Maurice Taylor, a human being. Taylor, 24, died a day after he was shot during an apparent burglary."
"Police said Taylor and his girlfriend, Jackie Garcia, were awakened by noise coming from the living room early November 26. Taylor got up and locked the bedroom door, but the door was kicked in and two shots were fired, police said. One struck Taylor in the leg. Garcia and"
Authorities have said Garcia told police she was hiding under the bedding during the attack. A breakin had been reported at Taylors residence eight days earlier. A police report from that incident said someone forced a window open and left a kitchen knife on a bed.
Football will pay its tribute to Busby Babes on the 50th anniversary of the Munich air disaster. Manchester United will hold a minute's silence for the legend at Old Trafford on Wednesday. The club will also hold a memorial service for the late Sir Bobby Charlton.
"Flight 609 ZU crashed on the third attempt to take off after refuelling in Germany. Eight players lost their lives on February 6, 1958, when United returned from knocking Red Star Belgrade out of the European Cup. Geoff Bent, aged 25, Roger Byrne28, Eddie Colman 21, Mark Jones 24, David Pegg 22, Tommy Taylor 26, Liam Whelan 22 and 21year-old Duncan Edwards who died in hospital 15 days after the crash. A commemorative service will be held at Old Trafford while a short ceremony will also take place at the memorial site in Kirchtrudering."
"In keeping with tradition, United supporters will also gather under the memorial plaque at Old Trafford where the clock is fixed at the exact time of the final fateful takeoff attempt. Later in the day, a minutes silence will take place ahead of Englands friendly with Switzerland at Wembley as a further mark of respect. Goalkeeper Gregg, hailed a hero in the wake of the crash after returning to the wreckage to pull out survivors, is adamant those are the times which always burn brightest in his memory."
"I was part of something that was a very, very beautiful thing at that time, says Gregg. The fact theres going to be a minutes silence after 50 years is a tribute to the people I played with, but one must remember as well there were other people on board that aircraft, a lot more people. The presidents of Sudan and Chad signed a nonaggression agreement late Thursday, aiming to halt crossborder hostilities between the two African nations."
"The signing came after nearly two full days of talks in Dakar, Senegal. The idea is to get the governments of Sudan and Chad to normalize their relations with each other. Each country accuses the other of supporting armed rebel groups that cross the border to attempt to destabilize the government. U.N. Secretary General Ban Kimoon met with officials from both nations and witnessed the signing of the agreement at about 10 p.m. ET."
"The United Nations says refugees and armed groups have been regularly crossing the border between the troubled Darfur region of Sudan and Chad. They allegedly include many of the rebels that attacked NDjamena, the capital of Chad, in early February."
"More than 10,000 people from Darfur, in Sudan, have fled into 12 official refugee camps in eastern Chad. They join some 240,000 Darfurians who have lived in Chad since 2004 because of fighting in their homeland. The number of displaced Chadians is growing because of the recent fighting there, Kingsley Amaning says. The United Nations, which has peacekeeping troops in the Darfur region, will work to assure Sudan and Chad carry out the terms of Thursdays deal."
"Sen. Larry Craig, RIdaho, initially said he would resign at the end of September but then changed his mind. Craig wants the Minnesota Court of Appeals to overturn a judges decision refusing to let him withdraw a guilty plea. Craig has maintained that he is innocent of any illegal conduct at the Minneapolis airport, his lawyer says."
"Craig says he has the constitutional right to make every effort to clear his name. Martin called the judges decision a manifest injustice. Craig said we dont know what the appellate court will say to me. Honestly, the appeals courts tend to defend the courts below them."
"It is my right to do what Im doing. Ive already provided for Idaho the certainty that Idaho needed, Im not running for reelection. Im no longer in the way. I am pursuing my constitutional rights."
Craig entered a guilty plea after his arrest in a mens room at the MinneapolisSt. Paul International Airport for allegedly propositioning a plainclothes police officer for sex. Craig originally said he would resign from the Senate on September 30 if he could not get the guilty plea withdrawn.
"I am innocent of the charges against me, he said at the time. The Idaho lawmakers decision not to resign has created a political headache for the Senates Republican leadership. When news of the arrest first surfaced, GOP leaders called for an investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee."
"Sen. John Ensign of Nevada leads the GOPs Senate campaign committee. In an interview taped Sunday with NBCs Matt Lauer, Craig complained that Mitt Romney threw me under the campaign bus when news of his arrest came out. Craig told Lauer in the interview set to run Tuesday night, according to MSNBC.com."
"Romney, former governor of Massachusetts, called Craigs behavior disgraceful and urged the senator to resign when news of the arrest broke in August. Craig was Romneys Senate liaison before resigning from the campaign. Romney spokesman Kevin Madden defended the presidential candidates response."
"Also in the Lauer interview, Craig and his wife, Suzanne, denied that their marriage is a cover for his homosexuality. The senator has denied he is gay. I love this woman very, very much, Larry Craig said."
Queen Elizabeth helped launch Heathrow's 8.6 billion new Terminal 5 on Friday. The move is part of the British airports rejuvenation plan to maintain its status as one of the worlds most important transport hubs. Suzanne Craig: I felt like the floor was falling out from under me when I heard the news.
The first flights from the new terminal are scheduled for March 27. It is part of a strategy which could lead to passenger numbers almost doubling to 122 million a year. A sixth terminal and a third runway are in the pipeline despite some vociferous opposition. The British monarch also opened Heathrows first passenger terminal in 1955.
"Spanishowned BAA also plans to eventually demolish Terminals 1 and 2 and replace them in a project called Heathrow East. Terminal 5 stands as a monument to the bingeflying culture this Government has done so much to encourage, Greenpeace transport campaigner Anita Goldsmith said. Its part of an obsession with expansion which can only mean more flights, more emissions and more climate change."
"Richard Dyer of Friends of the Earth said Heathrow expansion would be environmentally irresponsible. But business groups welcomed the expansion at Heathrow. Thriving, growing airports are vital to help maintain Britains economic competitiveness, Neil Pakey, chairman of the Airport Operators Association, said. Domestic air links to Heathrow are particularly valuable for the regional economies, he said."
The passage of the current Planning Bill must ensure that this is the last airport which has to endure such an absurdly protracted planning process. Visit London chief executive James Bidwell said T5 will provide visitors to London and the UK with a spectacular first impression. The terminals smoother checkin process and stateoftheart baggage management system will certainly better the tourist experience.
"18-year-old Khiel Coppin can be heard saying, Ive got a gun, police say. The teen put an object under his shirt and told his mother around the time she phoned 911 that he was going to say he had a gun. He told her, Im prepared to die, New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly says."
"When authorities arrived at the BedfordStuyvesant apartment, the teenager had something stuffed under his shirt. Coppin ignored repeated commands to stop and get on the ground. Witnesses said the teen appeared to be holding an object underneath his shirt and pointed it at the officers."
"Twenty shots were fired Coppin was struck eight times, Kelly said. Kelly said the teens mother reported he had not taken his antidepressant and antipsychotic medication. Police have not recovered a gun and do not believe he was armed."
"A reporter asked Kelly if its possible the young man was goading police to shoot him. Thats certainly a possibility, said Kelly. The boy didnt have no gun, he had a brush on him, said Andre Wildman."
"At least see a gun before you start to discharge it, Holder said. Police dont even have to see it, if they think you got one, youre going to get shot. Al Sharptons National Action Network is expected to hold a news conference on Tuesday."
"Police are investigating whether Coppin had a history of mental illness. The shooting came a year after unarmed groom Sean Bell, 23, was killed hours before his wedding. In 1999, unarmed African immigrant Amadou Diallo, 22, died when police in the Bronx shot him 19 times."
"Coppin was seen pacing around the apartment prior to the shooting. He began screaming from the window at his mother and the police, police say. At some point, the male climbed out of the window and began crossing the sidewalk."
"The Amazon rainforest is so vast and full of life that even its defenders dont know exactly what it is they are protecting. In the past 40 years, roughly 20 percent of the rainforest has been wiped out."
"The Amazon rainforest is considered the worlds richest and most varied natural habitat. Several million species of insects, plants, birds and fish call it home. It also plays an important role in regulating Earths temperature as its dense vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide and releases oxygen into the air. The wealth of biodiversity is so immense, we cannot even estimate the amount we dont know, says Cláudio C. Maretti."
"The Amazon has been under pressure from outside forces for decades. In the past 40 years, roughly 20 percent of the rainforest has been wiped out. Maretti says an additional 17 percent has been degraded to varying degrees."
"The Amazon rainforest is just one of many habitats around the world threatened by encroaching development or natural resource extraction. The Food and Agriculture Organization FAO of the United Nations estimates that 50,000 square miles of forest are lost each year because of clearing and degradation."
"Cambodia lost nearly 30 percent of its primary forests from 2000 to 2005, according to FAO. Vietnam lost close to 55 percent ofIts primary forests, FAO found. Nigeria lost nearly 56 percent of Its primary forests over the same period, the worst rate of forest loss in the world."
"Half of the world's forests have been destroyed in the last 30 years, says Greenpeace. The chief driver of forest destruction is the buying and selling of forest products in the international market, says Scott Paul, Forest Campaign Coordinator for Greenpeace. Paul would like to see a certification system so that consumers know the source and conditions under which the product theyre consuming was harvested."
" forests lost to logging and agriculture are actually growing back in some areas. This thrills some wildlife advocates who would like to see the restoration of exiled or decimated species. Northern New England is the only place in the eastern United States where you have the potential for largescale wilderness where wolves, lynxes, cougars, woodland caribou and salmon rivers could be restored, says Michael J. Kellett, executive director of RESTORE The North Woods."
"Kelletts biggest fear is that real estate development could begin to carve up the vast forests of Maine. His proposed solution create a national park. In Brazil in recent years, the government reportedly has stepped up efforts to slow the Amazons destruction."
"Environmental groups say the drop also was caused by the fall of soy prices and the rise of Brazils currency against the dollar. The World Wildlife Funds Maretti is hopeful that Brazil, with international help, will be able to protect even more of the Amazon."
